; Note: There is a one byte sequence for [nl] and three spaces.
;       Don't attempt to save space by removing those spaces,
;       you will only make things worse...
;       Similar for [pause]s, [pausenl]s and [cls]s.
;
; Note: The character names used in this script are:
;       Crono Marle Lucca Frog Robos Ayla Magus Epoch
;       "Robos" is used instead of "Robo" to make it possible
;       to use words starting with "Robo" (like "Robot") without
;       them breaking when the player changes the character names.
;       This has no effect to the game. Do not try changing all
;       instances of "Robos" to "Robo". It will break the game.
;
; Note: The order of strings (each starts with $) inside a block
;       (each starts with *) can be changed, but they can't be moved
;       from block to another.
;
;
; All supported label types:
;  *d    = dict
;          entries are: $hexnumber:value
;          hexnumber is ignored; only the order matters
;  *sNN  = free space record (at page NN)
;          entries are: $hexnum1:hexnum2
;          hexnum1 marks beginning, hexnum2 marks ending
;  *z    = dialog string (12pix zstring)
;          entries are: $base62num:value
;          base62num refers to the address of the pointer
;  *r    = status string (8pix zstring)
;          entries are: $base62num:value
;          base62num refers to the address of the pointer
;  *lNN  = fixed width = NN
;          entries are: $base62num:value
;          base62num refers to the address of the value
;  *iNN  = relocatable item table (original width = NN)
;          same meaning as *l                          
;  *tNN  = relocatable tech table (original width = NN)
;          same meaning as *l
;  *mNN  = relocatable monster table (original width = NN)
;          same meaning as *l
;  *c    = compressed blob, may contain 8pix text
;  *eNN  = location event - pointed from NN (base62)

I give up.
[pause]
I'll tell you everything, squeek.

Press and hold the L&R Buttons and then press the A button to access the secret passage, squeek.
[pause]
Don't make any mistakes, or you'll be sorry!
$8SFu:
Marle: Phew![nl]
   Something reeks!
$8SFw:
Lucca: Everything's completely rotten.[nl]
   The refrigeration must have failed...
$8SFy:
Marle: Crono, look!!
[pause]
   ...
[pause]
   ...
[pause]
   Passed away long ago, I suppose...
$8SG0:
Marle: He's holding something.[nl]
   What do you suppose this is?
$8SG2:
Lucca: It looks like some kind of seed.
$8SG4:
Marle: A seed?[nl]
   Do you suppose it could grow in a place like this?
$8SG6:
The following is written on a soiled sheet of paper...
[pause]
The rat is more than just a statue![nl]
It knows the secret of this dome.[nl]
Catch it!
$8SG8:
Executing program...
$8SGA:
Marle: Crono![nl]
   What's going on?!
$8SGC:
Lucca: Marle!
[pause]
   Let's go!
$8SGE:
OLD MAN: ......
$8SGG:
OLD MAN: NO!
[pause]
   You MUST NOT climb Death Peak!
[pause]
   Wouldn't make it very far, anyway![nl]
   It has to be the right time...[nl]
   ...and...THEY...have to show you the way!
$8SGI:
OLD MAN: Schala...I've missed you so...
$8SGK:
OLD MAN: Say!
[pause]
   Did you see my masterpieces?[nl]
   The Ocean Palace and the Blackbird?[nl]
   I designed and built them both.
$8SGM:
STRANGE CREATURE: I am pleased you[nl]
   think me worthy, O wise one![nl]
   I await your final program code!
[pause]
OLD MAN: Now, don't go getting all[nl]
   emotional on me, critter![nl]
   Back to work, now!
$8SGO:
Huh...?
$8SGQ:
To those who opened the door...
[pause]
I am Belthasar, the Guru of Reason.[nl]
I once lived in the kingdom of Zeal.
[pause]
A great disaster in Zeal somehow threw me into this era.
[pause]
To my surprise, Lavos exists here, and, I suspect, in other periods as well.[nl]
Aeons ago, Lavos descended from the heavens.
[pause]
Burrowing deep into the the world's core, he began to consume our planet's energy, and grow stronger.
$8SGS:
Lavos disappeared briefly when he was summoned away by a mighty wizard who lived in Guardia, in the year 600.
[pause]
In 1999, Lavos claims this area, and reigns from high atop Death Peak.
[pause]
Lavos continues to replicate......[nl]
like a giant parasite, he is consuming our world.
$8SGU:
Forced to live here, I continued to conduct research on Lavos.[nl]
But I am growing old.
[pause]
And it's impossible to keep sane in such trying times. So before I lose it completely, I shall safeguard my data, and my ultimate creation...
$8SGW:
How I long to return home...[nl]
But I have grown frail...
[pause]
So you...YOU, who have opened the door![nl]
I leave things in your hands.
[pause]
Only by mastering time, itself, do you stand a chance against Lavos.
$8SGY:
The odds will be against you...[nl]
But you are true heros.[nl]
The world is in your hands.
[pause]
Open, now, the last door, and take what you find there.[nl]
My last invention...
[pause]
My «Wings of Time» ...
$8SGa:
Marle: Wow...this is amazing...
[pause]
   How do you tell the front from the back?
$8SGc:
Lucca: This must be the invention Belthasar spoke of.
$8SGe:
Robos: The Wings of Time... I believe I have heard of this device.
$8SGg:
Frog: This...moves through time?
$8SGi:
Ayla: !!
[pause]
   What this thing?
$8SGk:
A curious crest is engraved here.[nl]
Some unknown power keeps it sealed.
$8SGm:
The pendant shimmers...!
$8SGo:
STRANGE CREATURE: The professor's[nl]
   programming was, in a sense, his own eulogy.
[pause]
   Soon, I, too, will be able to sleep forever.
[pause]
   But first...
[pause]
   There is one thing I must do.
[pause]
   ......
[pause]
   ......
[pause]
   ......
[pause]
   Program error...[nl]
   ...my memory banks have failed...
$8SGq:
STRANGE CREATURE: Please, do not[nl]
   disturb my slumber.
$8SGs:
STRANGE CREATURE: Caution.[nl]
   The Time Axis is out of order.
$8SGu:
STRANGE CREATURE: Scared you, didn't I?
[pause]
   It's me......BELTHASAR
[pause]
   I copied my memory into this thing.[nl]
   What do you think?
[pause]
   Anyway, there's something I need to explain.
[pause]
   Namely, how to transcend time!
[pause]
   Press the Y Button for the time gauge.
[pause]
   Then use the L&R Buttons to select an era.
$8SGw:
BELTHASAR: Oh, yeah![nl]
   Before you go, why don't you...
$8SGy:
BELTHASAR: ...name my time machine!
$8SH0:
BELTHASAR: Hop aboard!
$8SH2:
No dozing off, now![delay 00]
$8SH4:
STRANGE CREATURE: Instructions for the[nl]
   time machine are as follows.
[pause]
   The Y Button displays the time gauge.
[pause]
   Use the L & R Buttons and Control Pad to select a destination in time.
[pause]
   Press the A Button to board and get off the device, and to warp through time.
[pause]
   End Professor's message.

   I've got a bad feeling about this...
$8SHM:
Ayla: Bad place![nl]
   Much danger.
$8SHO:

Go around back and press the switch!
$8SHQ:
GUARD: The 3 of them are almost here!
$8SHS:
SIR KRAWLIE: Coming through the[nl]

   They must have a death wish![nl]
   We shall teach them a lesson!
$8SHU:
GUARD: Let's show 'em.[nl]
   HEE HEE!
$8SHW:
SIR KRAWLIE: Just let them come[nl]

$8SHs:
AZALA: Mwa ha ha! With this Black Tyrano I can finally exterminate those filthy apes!
$8SHu:
AZALA: So...you are here at last.[nl]
   This is it, then.[nl]
   The showdown.[nl]
   Today there shall be a conclusion.
[pause]
   Will it be the Reptites, or you silly apes who end up ruling the world?
$8SHw:
Ayla: Strong survive.[nl]
   Ayla strong.[nl]
   Ayla fight!
$8SHy:
AZALA: Though it may be our fate to perish, we will not simply hand this world over to you!
$8SI0:
AZALA: No...It can't be...![nl]
   Could the heavens truly have sided with the apes?
[pause]
   Listen, primates, and let it be known.[nl]
   We Reptites fought bravely to the bitter end!
$8SI2:
Ayla: Ayla understand...
$8SI4:
Ayla: !?
$8SI6:
AZALA: Soon, stones of fire will rain down.[nl]
   Flames shall scorch the land.
[pause]
   The burned out plains will slowly freeze, ushering in a long, cruel ice age.
[pause]
   Mwa, ha ha...what a treat![nl]
   You will wish you went along with us!
[pause]
   Mwa ha!
$8SI8:
Ayla: Lavos...
$8SIA:
Marle: Pardon?
$8SIC:
Lucca: La...Lavos!?
$8SIE:
Robos: Lavos...Impossible!
$8SIG:

   «Vos» mean big...

AZALA: We...have no future...

$8SIm:
NIZBEL: Hold it.

   This is a special place.[nl]
   The great Nizbel was defeated here!
$8SIo:
NIZBEL: Well, well!
[pause]
   Out for a little stroll, are we?
$8SIq:
UNDERLING: Press the switch, and the bridge opens, ribbit!

   It's out of reach, ribbit!
$8SIw:

$8SIy:
There's a diary.[nl]
Here's the last page.
[pause]
It's all over.[nl]
The fishmen attack if I make even the slightest noise.
[pause]
I'd rather have my gums scraped than have to fight these fiends.

STRANGE CREATURE: I will now deliver a[nl]
   message from the professor.
$8SJK:
BELTHASAR: On «Death Peak» you will find the power to restore life.
[pause]
   But to activate this power, the deceased must be important to the space-time continuum.
[pause]
   And you MUST have a clone identical to that person. Only then, can a Chrono Trigger work its magic...
$8SJM:
BELTHASAR: Enough.
[pause]
   The time has come for you to attempt «Death Peak.» It's the only chance you have of reviving your friend.
[pause]
   The last program I've implanted in this creature's memory banks will help you up the mountain.[nl]
   Stand back.
$8SJO:
BELTHASAR: Without the Clone, there's no point in going to «Death Peak!»[nl]
   Now, scram!
$8SJQ:
BELTHASAR: Need a Clone?[nl]
   The magician, Nolstein Bekkler could whip one up in the wink of an eye.
[pause]
   Bekkler loves festivals. Find a festival, and there, too, you shall find Bekkler!
$8SJS:
Executing program!
$8SJU:
BELTHASAR: The 3 entities you saw will help you climb «Death Peak.»
[pause]
   This ends my message.
[pause]
   Now I must ask you for a favor.
[pause]
   This creature has executed its program.[nl]
   Please let him sleep.[nl]
   The switch is on his stomach.
$8SJW:
Switch the creature off?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$8SJY:
This creature sleeps beyond the flow of time.
$8SJa:
3 of you! And in a place like THIS![nl]
You've got a long journey ahead of you so please rest awhile.
[pause]
And if you wish to awaken from this dream, there probably is a way...
$8SJc:
What will you do?[nl]
      Wake up.[nl]
      Stay.
$8SJe:
Hey![nl]
We've got a customer!
$8SJg:

   This's ending already?
$8SKC:
Lucca: That's what that word usually means!
$8SKE:
Marle: But things were just starting to get interesting!
$8SKG:
Lucca: Well, come on folks, let's do the «ending» thing.
$8SKI:
Marle: ROLL THE CREDITS![nl]
   But first, let's remember all the fun things we did!
$8SKK:
Lucca: Okay![nl]
   Let the ultimate slide show begin!
$8SKM:
Marle: First, let's see a close up of Leene Square!
$8SKO:
Lucca: There's the Steel Runner.
$8SKQ:
Marle: I've never understood why anyone would want to run for 3 hours at a stretch...
$8SKS:
Lucca: Forget that![nl]
   Can you imagine what the inside of that armor must smell like?
$8SKU:
Marle: What a lovely thought, Lucca.[nl]
   Let's get on with the show, OKAY?!
$8SKW:
Lucca: Next let's visit Guardia Castle, your home.
$8SKY:
Marle: Goodness![nl]
   VERY nice scenery!
$8SKa:
Lucca: But of course, my dear!
$8SKc:
Marle: I guess you never took a shot at him, right?[nl]
   Say, didn't he just wink at you?
$8SKe:
Lucca: RELAX, Marle!!
$8SKg:
Marle: Hey![nl]
   It's Pierre!
$8SKi:
Lucca: Wouldn't want anything to do with someone like HIM.[nl]
   Too shifty...[nl]
   He should be put on trial!
$8SKk:
Marle: Come on, Lucca![nl]
   Live it up a little![nl]
   Let your hair down![nl]
   Get Crazy!!!
$8SKm:
Lucca: Yeah, thanks PRINCESS.[nl]
   I'll take that under advisement!!
$8SKo:
Marle: There's the seed.[nl]
   Hope it grows...
$8SKq:
Lucca: Theeeeere's Johnny...[nl]
   Mr. Speed himself!
$8SKs:
Marle: Someone ought to tell him to take a permanent pit stop.[nl]
   Look at that hair!
$8SKu:
Lucca: Hey, check it out![nl]
   He's really a tricycle![nl]
   Pass him!
$8SKw:
Marle: Try again when you learn to RIDE.
$8SKy:
Lucca: There's that stuffed-shirt, Cyrus!
$8SL0:
Marle: He IS pretty handsome, though...
$8SL2:
Lucca: But WHERE does he buy his clothes?
$8SL4:
Marle: Hey, did you hear?[nl]
   He plucks his eyebrows!
$8SL6:
Lucca: You've GOT to be joking![nl]
   But...he's still a hunk!
$8SL8:
Marle: Hi, Toma![nl]
   Now HE'S definitely my type!
$8SLA:
Lucca: Aw, he's just a flake.
$8SLC:
Marle: Probably has a dozen girlfriends.
$8SLE:
Lucca: Actually, I see him as more of an intellectual!
$8SLG:
Marle: What about him?[nl]
   That Kino guy?
$8SLI:
Lucca: Total Neanderthal![nl]
   Throw him a bone!
$8SLK:
Marle: But he's honest.[nl]
   That's kind of attractive.
$8SLM:
Lucca: He walks like a DUCK!!
$8SLO:
Marle: Well, he'll never hurt anyone.
$8SLQ:
Lucca: He's really very gentle, isn't he?
$8SLS:
Lucca: Crono!!!
$8SLU:
Crono: What ARE you two doing?![nl]
   I thought you said something about a nice little slide show?
$8SLW:
Marle: So, we got a little carried away!
$8SLY:
Lucca: Where do you want to go next?!
$8SLa:
Marle: Some place fun!!
$8SLc:
Crono: How about into the «now» ?!
$8SLe:
Lucca: Now, as in the present?
$8SLg:
Marle: Okay![nl]
   Back to the present!
$8SLi:
Lucca: So I guess we don't need a Gate Key anymore, right?
$8SLk:
Lucca: Hey![nl]
   Wait a sec!!!

$F2Xu:
Frog: 'Tis a feisty crowd![nl]
   But they are thine kin, and 'tis of consequence.
[pause]
   Queen Leene awaits.[nl]
   Your Majesty, we too shall take our leave.
$F2Xw:
Marle: Mr. Frog...
$F2Xy:
Frog: ...[nl]
   Long farewells ne'er were necessary.
$F2Y0:
Marle: Right![nl]
   Besides, actions speak louder than words!
$F2Y2:
Lucca: Yeah. Don't these things end with the princess kissing the frog?
$F2Y4:
Marle: So...you're going to search for Schala?
$F2Y6:
Robos: Lucca, I will miss you.
$F2Y8:
Robos: Lucca, I will miss you.
$F2YA:
Marle: What's wrong Lucca?[nl]
   Aren't you going to say goodbye to Robos?
$F2YC:
Robos: She knows.
[pause]
Marle: Knows...what?
$F2YE:
Lucca: ......
[pause]
   Robos was born in a bleak future.[nl]
   When we defeated Lavos, we changed history.
[pause]
   Robos...may not exist in the future.
$F2YG:
Robos: Ha ha.[nl]
   Please relax.[nl]
   The new future has a place for me!
$F2YI:
Lucca: Darn it, Robos![nl]
   Don't pretend you don't care when you're really sad![nl]
   It just makes things worse!
$F2YK:
Robos: ......[nl]
   Lucca, YOU have taught me these emotions.[nl]
   Thank you.
$F2YM:
Marle: Tears don't become you, Lucca![nl]
   Robos'll be there in the new future!
$F2YO:
Robos: Good...bye.
$F2YQ:
Robos: Caution![nl]
   Oil has washed over my sight sensors.[nl]
   Sight diminished...
$F2YS:
Marle: I guess this wraps things up.
$F2YU:
SOLDIER: Oh, Princess, the King asks for your presence.
$F2YW:
Marle: Time travel...how exhausting!
$F2YY:
Lucca: We should dismantle the Epoch.[nl]
   Its job is finished.
$F2Ya:
MOM: You naughty thing, come back here!
$F2Yc:
MOM: Look, Crono![nl]
   Your cat's running away because you haven't been feeding it!
$F2Ye:
MOM: Hey, come back here!
$F2Yg:
Marle: Oh, great![nl]
   Crono, that Gate will never open again!
$F2Yi:
Lucca: Well it looks like we have no choice but to go after them!
$F2Yk:
Marle: Go after them?![nl]
   But the Gate's...
$F2Ym:
Marle: Lucca, don't turn off your brain, yet!
$F2Yo:
Lucca: I forgot![nl]
   We have a Time Machine!
$F2Yq:
[nl]
                  Nya ha ha!
$F2Ys:
Lucca: Do you remember that talk we had?
$F2Yu:
Marle: You mean about whether our lives flash by before we die?
$F2Yw:
Lucca: Yeah. I get the feeling that the «Entity» is finally at rest.
[pause]
Marle: Yes, I feel that too...
$F2Yy:
Lucca: I thought Lavos made the Gates...[nl]
   But I guess I was wrong.
$F2Z0:
Marle: What do you mean?
$F2Z2:
Lucca: I think a greater force wanted us to experience those events.
$F2Z4:
Marle: What's up?![nl]
   How did everyone get here?[nl]
   The Gate's been shut!
$F2Z6:
Lucca: Heh heh, I tinkered with the Telepod.
$F2Z8:
Marle: And made it into a time machine?
$F2ZA:
Marle: You're the guy from the End of Time!
[pause]
GASPAR: You forgot the «Time Egg!»[nl]
   The «Time Egg» is used for...
[pause]
   blah, blah, blah...[nl]
   etc, etc, etc...
[cls]
   etc, etc, etc...[nl]
   etc, etc, etc...

   ...[delay EF] You got that?
$F2ZC:
Marle: You mean we can get Crono back?
[pause]
GASPAR: Yes, that's possible.
$F2ZE:
Marle: Th, that's why you're all here?
$F2ZG:
Marle: Let's get Crono!
$F2ZI:
Lucca: Why don't you stay here with your dad?
[pause]
Marle: But...
[pause]
Lucca: Don't worry![nl]
   I'll bring the idiot back!
$F2ZK:
Lucca: Trust me!
$F2ZM:
Marle: I wonder how everyone is doing.
$F2ZO:
Ayla: Give me «Time Egg!»
[pause]
GASPAR: Calm down.[nl]
   Rushing won't bring him back!
$F2ZQ:
Ayla: Ok, understand.[nl]
   Now hurry, give!
$F2ZS:
Robos: Hey![nl]
   He is escaping!
$F2ZU:
Marle: What's going on, everyone?
$F2ZW:
That «Time Egg» of his can bring HIM back!
[pause]
Lucca: Bring who back?[nl]
You mean Crono?
$F2ZY:
Yes.
$F2Za:
Marle: By the way, who...are you?
$F2Zc:
Marle: He just took off.
[pause]
Lucca: Could that have been...[nl]
   Frog?
$F2Ze:
Lucca: H,[delay EF]he's handsome!
$F2Zg:
Lucca: Let's catch up with him!
$F2Zi:
Lucca: Hey Frog![nl]
   Why didn't you tell us you were a dish?
$F2Zk:
KING: I have a gift for you, to commemorate this day, Princess Nadia.
$F2Zm:
Marle: It's...
[pause]
KING: It's Nadia's Bell, which will replace the 400 year old Leene Bell.[nl]
   Henceforth, Nadia's Bell will proudly ring for lasting peace.
$F2Zo:
Marle: It's beautiful!
$F2Zq:
KING: Now, you can do the honors.
$F2Zs:
Marle: Done!
$F2Zu:
Marle: Huh?![nl]
   H, hey Crono, help me!
$F2Zw:
Marle: ?![nl]
   H, help!!
$F2Zy:
TABAN: Phew![nl]
   Made it just in time![nl]
   Shall I fire one off?[delay 09]   
[cls]
KING: Uh, no Taban.[nl]
   Actually, I could really use your help...[delay EF][delay 00]
$F2a0:
KING: I'm so happy![nl]
   Now there's no reason for you to go away anymore.
$F2a2:
Marle: Daddy...[nl]
   I hate to say this but...[delay 06]I can't sit around doing nothing!
$F2a4:
KING: This is Nadia's Bell.[nl]
   It will ring out across the land.
$F2a6:
KING: Marle...where did you go?[nl]
   Could someone please lend me a hand?

Hard to believe Guardia is now 1000 years old, and our King is the XXXIII descendant to the throne!
[pause]
But how can he rule a kingdom when he can't even control his own daughter?!
$F7j0:
There used to be a cathedral in the woods to the west.
[pause]
I wonder what became of it?
$F7j2:
ELAINE: If only Fritz would return.[nl]
   I'd ask for nothing more!
$F7j4:
ELAINE: I guess he's forgotten me.
$F7j6:
Sometimes a mysterious whirlpool appears in the ocean near here.[nl]
What could cause that?
$F7j8:
It's 10 G to Porre.[nl]
Hop aboard?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7jA:
Lodging is 10 G.[nl]
      Check in?[nl]
      No, thanks.
$F7jC:
Been to the fair yet?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7jE:
Well get going, then!![nl]
You'll have to wait a thousand years for another Millennial Fair!
$F7jG:
Wasn't that a trip?! I spent all my Silver Points at the «Tent of Horrors!»
$F7jI:
Are you buying?[nl]
      Sure.[nl]
      Sorry.
$F7jK:
Remember the earthquake we just[nl]

Airhead, huh?[nl]
Well, never mind.
$F7jO:
We've been having too many.[nl]
Something's wrong...[nl]
Hope the «Big One» isn't coming!

I'll play you a song.
$F7jU:
See ya around.
$F7jW:
Come on in![nl]
Take your bloody time...![nl]
I'd rather serve you than go to the fair, anyway...
$F7jY:
Why is there a different guard on duty at the castle every time I go there?
$F7ja:
Hi![nl]
Do you know about our establishment?[nl]
      No.[nl]
      Yes.
$F7jc:
This is the Mayor's Education Center.[nl]
Think of it as a workshop for beginners!
[pause]
You can take the things you find here!
$F7je:
Scattered throughout this world are places where you can save your game.[nl]
Save whenever you can, especially in unfamiliar or dangerous areas!
$F7jg:
That's just a replica. Record your journey whenever you find the real McCoy!
[pause]
You'll find more of them in riskier areas.
[pause]
Also, remember that you can log in anywhere on the World Map!
$F7ji:
Need a brief Weapons and Items[nl]
seminar?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7jk:
Weapons include swords, bows, and guns.
[pause]
Some weapons can only be used by specific party members.
[pause]
You'll find a variety of armor for the head and body.
[pause]
Finally, there are numerous accessories with unique properties and effects.
[pause]
As you gain Power, swords will inflict greater damage. Bows and guns get more powerful as your Hit rate increases.
$F7jm:
You can walk while reading messages.[nl]
But go too far, and you can miss them!
$F7jo:
Use the Y Button to move the Message/Battle window up or down.
$F7jq:
Want my advice?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7js:
Ask the Mayor first.
$F7ju:
All right, I'll teach you about skills. Are[nl]
you willing to learn?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7jw:
That's about it.[nl]
Feel more confident?
$F7jy:
You've got potential![nl]
You'll learn a number of «Techniques»[nl]
as you progress!
[pause]
«Techniques» are magic attacks that also utilize your weapons.[nl]
You'll acquire them with discipline.
$F7k0:
My, my! You're so enthusiastic![nl]
Use this to help you get started!
[pause]
[nl]
               A gift of 300 G!
$F7k2:
Want to learn about damage in[nl]
battle?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7k4:
Do you know about «Shelters?»[nl]
They're quite useful![nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7k6:
Use «Shelters» at Save Points, or on the World Map, to completely restore HP and MP.
$F7k8:
Some monsters have special attacks.
$F7kA:
Poison[nl]
   HP slowly decreases.[nl]
   Your attacks are weakened.
$F7kC:
Slow[nl]
   Increases the time between attacks.
$F7kE:
Sleep[nl]
   Lowers your guard.[nl]
   A good hit will wake you up again!
$F7kG:
Chaos[nl]
   Confuses you into attacking allies![nl]
   A little tough on friendships!
$F7kI:
Blind[nl]
   You can't see too well...[nl]
   It's hard to hit enemies!
$F7kK:
Lock[nl]
   Can't use any «Techniques.»
$F7kM:
Stop[nl]
   Immobilizes and disables you.
$F7kO:
In these situations your guard is down, and you'll sustain more damage.
[pause]
Use «Heal,» or wait until the battle ends to heal automatically.
$F7kQ:
Would you like to hear more?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7kS:
When your HP hits 0, you'll be disabled.[nl]
Use «Revive» to restore yourself, but if everyone goes down, you're through.
[pause]
Be careful!
$F7kU:
Hold down the L and R Buttons to escape from battle![nl]
Know when to run![nl]
But you need to fight to grow strong!
[pause]
Now, about the Equip menu...[nl]
Numbers next to the Sword and Shield icons indicate Attack and Defense power.
[pause]
The higher the number, the greater the power.
[pause]
«M. Def.» indicates your ability to block magic attacks. If it's 10, then magic damage will be reduced by 10%.
[pause]
A star after any characteristic means it's at maximum strength.

$F7ky:
FRITZ: Crono!![nl]
   I owe you one![nl]
   You saved my skin back there.
$F7l0:
FRITZ: Man, was I up the creek![nl]
   I went off on a buying trip, and ended up getting jailed with a bunch of thieves!
[pause]
   The officials planned to execute me without a trial![nl]
   What has gotten into them?
$F7l2:
ELAINE: We're forever in your debt![nl]
   Thank you, again!
$F7l4:
FRITZ: Hope my Dad never hears about this.
[pause]
[nl]
             Get 10 Mid Ethers!
$F7l6:
Not enough cash!
$F7l8:
Thank you very much.
$F7lA:
Millennial Fair?[nl]
What?[nl]
Are you crazy?![nl]
What nonsense!
$F7lC:
«Where am I?» Are you stupid?[nl]
THIS is the kingdom of Guardia![nl]
We're battling Magus's army.
$F7lE:
You DID know that, right?[nl]
      Of course.[nl]
      No.
$F7lG:
Then shut your pie hole!
$F7lI:
Lovely...[nl]
We NEED more ignorant strangers around here...
$F7lK:
The Magus's army destroyed Zenan Bridge, so the south continent is inaccessible.
$F7lM:
What a relief![nl]
They finally found Queen Leene wandering up in the mountains!
$F7lO:
She must be glad to be home!
$F7lQ:
The Queen has been through a lot![nl]
She's babbling about the oddest thing.
$F7lS:
Everyone was worried![nl]
The King freaked when the Queen took off.
[pause]
We all thought Magus had grabbed her.[nl]
Thank goodness she's safe!
$F7lU:
TOMA: Are you a stranger here, too?[nl]
   I'm Toma, the explorer.[nl]
   If you're buying, I'll tell you a story.
$F7lW:
How about it?[nl]
      Sure.[nl]
      No.
$F7lY:
TOMA: Thanks![nl]
   It's about the missing Queen.
[pause]
   She disappeared while visiting that cathedral to the west, and...
[pause]
   Beg your pardon?[nl]
   WHAT?![nl]
   They FOUND her?[nl]
   Never mind...
$F7la:
TOMA: I was sure there was something fishy about that cathedral...
$F7lc:
TOMA: So, you think I'm a beggar, huh?![nl]
   Well, scram!
$F7le:
TOMA: How rude...
$F7lg:
That'll be 10 G.[nl]
Register?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7li:
Welcome!
$F7lk:
A Millennial Fair? Here?[nl]
What ARE you talking about?[nl]
It's the year 600, and the 21st King of Guardia reigns.
$F7lm:
We've been at war for years.[nl]
When will it end?
$F7lo:
I'm Banta, the blacksmith.[nl]
I'm forging a bell for the King to present to his beloved Queen Leene!
$F7lq:
I lost it when the Queen disappeared.[nl]
I just couldn't keep working on the bell.[nl]
But now it's back to business as usual!
$F7ls:
My husband wants a daughter who is as intelligent as she is beautiful.
$F7lu:
I had almost completed the bell when Magus's army wounded our King.[nl]
I've lost the will to work.
$F7lw:
I hope this bell will ring in a new world of peace.
$F7ly:
No window shoppers![nl]
Whaddaya want?
$F7m0:
Thanks.[nl]
See ya.
$F7m2:
You're going to fight Magus's army?[nl]
Wonderful! But remember to equip yourself with the weapons you buy!
$F7m4:
Marle: How do we get home?
$F7m6:
Lucca: Your Highness, er, Princess...we...
$F7m8:
Marle: Please call me Marle!
$F7mA:
Lucca: Well then, Marle...[nl]
   Observe!
$F7mC:
Marle: Wow!
$F7mE:
Marle: Lucca![nl]
   You're amazing!
$F7mG:
Lucca: Ain't it the truth!
$F7mI:
Lucca: Oh, um...I mean...
$F7mK:
Marle: Enough with the false modesty! You have a real gift![nl]
   I would trade my royal ancestry for your genius in a heartbeat!
$F7mM:
Lucca: Well, if you say so...
$F7mO:
Lucca: Anyway, I call this thing a «Gate.»
$F7mQ:
   It's a kind of portal, that takes you to the same location in a different era.
$F7mS:
   Gates are very unstable, so I used the principal behind my Telepod device...
$F7mU:
Lucca: ...to create a «Gate Key.»[nl]
   Now we can use them as we please.
$F7mW:
Marle: But why did this Gate suddenly appear?
$F7mY:
Lucca: Either the Telepod had something to do with it, or...something else made it.
$F7ma:
Marle: This is getting pretty weird.[nl]
   Let's at least head back to our own time!
$F7mc:
Lucca: All right![nl]
   Coming, Crono?
$F7me:
Is it true? I heard Magus's army has taken the bridge!
$F7mg:
They say the King has been wounded![nl]
Is this the end?
$F7mi:
No, the Hero has appeared![nl]
He'll save us!
$F7mk:
Have you heard?![nl]
The legendary Hero has appeared!
[pause]
He went to see the King.[nl]
Now Magus's army hasn't a chance!
$F7mm:
Wearing the «Hero Medal,» the chosen one has appeared![nl]
We're saved!
$F7mo:
I heard Magus's army is at the bridge.[nl]
We're in trouble now!
$F7mq:
Frog: Awake'th, Crono!
$F7ms:
Cider please!
$F7mu:
The Hero has brought us peace, and I have delivered the bell to the King.[nl]
What more could we ask for?
[pause]
Hurrah for Guardia!!![nl]
Let's toast our land!
$F7mw:
Now we'll have peace and prosperity.
$F7my:
Yahoooo!![nl]
Somebody STOP me!!![nl]
Hurrah to the Hero and Guardia!
$F7n0:
They've built a Town Square to celebrate peace.
$F7n2:
And they've named it after Queen Leene.
$F7n4:
What a happy occasion![nl]
Let's get crazy!
$F7n6:
Let's wage peace from now on!

Peace is ours!

   I think I can fix it.
$F7ow:
Marle: What?![nl]
   It might attack us!
$F7oy:
Lucca: I'll make sure it won't.[nl]
   Machines aren't capable of evil...
$F7p0:
   ...humans make them that way.
$F7p2:
Marle: Lucca, you...pity them don't you?
$F7p4:
Lucca: Let me get to work now, okay?

   I'm going to give it some juice!

$F7pK:
ROBOT: Understood.[nl]
   Madam Lucca fixed me.
$F7pM:
Lucca: Just Lucca will do.
$F7pO:
ROBOT: Impossible.[nl]
   That would be rude.
$F7pQ:
Lucca: Look, I hate formal titles![nl]
   Don't you, Marle?
$F7pS:
Marle: Hate 'em!
$F7pU:

   Now what's your name?

   Ah, my serial number.[nl]
   It is R66-Y.

   That won't do at all!

$F7pg:
Marle: Robos...[nl]
   Robos...that's perfect!
$F7pi:
Marle: Your new name is Robos, okay?
$F7pk:
ROBOT: I am... Robos.[nl]

$F7pm:
Lucca: Hey Robos, why aren't there any people here?
$F7po:
Robos: ......
[pause]
   What...[nl]
   What has happened here?
$F7pq:
Robos: There WERE many humans and others of my kind in this dome.
$F7ps:
Lucca: I think something awful happened here...
$F7pu:
Robos: ......
[pause]
   It would appear so...
$F7pw:
Robos: But how is it that you survived?
$F7py:
Lucca: We came through a time warp from the year 1000.
$F7q0:
Marle: While exploring Arris Dome we learned there was a Gate here.
$F7q2:
Lucca: We found you when we came looking for the Gate!
$F7q4:
Marle: But the door to the inner chambers is locked, so we're out of luck...
$F7q6:
Robos: The power is off.
$F7q8:
Robos: If we go to the factory up north, I can pass through security and activate this dome's generator.
$F7qA:
Marle: You'd do that for us?
$F7qC:
Robos: You repaired me.[nl]
   Now it's my turn to help you.
[pause]
   But the generator won't run for long, so someone must stay behind to open the door while the power's on.
$F7qE:
Lucca: Then Marle or I will stay.
$F7qG:
Who will stay behind?[nl]
      Marle[nl]
      Lucca
$F7qI:
Marle: Okay.[nl]
   Please be careful, Crono!
$F7qK:
Lucca: Right![nl]
   I'll handle things here!
$F7qM:
Marle: Hi! I was getting SO bored.[nl]
   May I take Lucca's place?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7qO:
Lucca: Looks like you need my[nl]
   genius after all![nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$F7qQ:
Marle: Okay, I'll wait here.
$F7qS:
Lucca: Oh, all right...
$F7qU:
Marle: The door won't budge.
$F7qW:
Robos: C...can you r...repair...me?
$F7qY:
Lucca: Shh, don't talk.
$F7qa:
Robos: You...are trying to save our world?
$F7qc:
Lucca: I don't know how far we'll get, but that's the plan.
$F7qe:
   Anyway Robos, what are you going to do when you're repaired?
$F7qg:
Robos: What am I...going to do?
$F7qi:
Lucca: Yeah. I mean, what plans do you have for the future?
$F7qk:
Robos: Lucca, no one has ever asked me that before!
$F7qm:
Robos: Good morning.
$F7qo:
Marle: Robos![nl]
   You're all right!!
$F7qq:
Marle: Lucca, you're incredible!
$F7qs:
Lucca: I hope I never have to do that again...
$F7qu:
Robos: Lucca, I have made up my mind.[nl]
   I want to go with you...
$F7qw:
Marle: Pardon?
$F7qy:
Robos: There is nothing left for me here.[nl]
   Together, maybe we can give this planet of ours a chance.
$F7r0:
Lucca: Then let's go![nl]
   The Gate's up ahead!!
$F7r2:

And yet you still want to fight?[nl]

Lavos's children will one day have to leave to seek new planets, and prey.

ATROPOS: Now step back Prometheus.[nl]
   We'll get rid of these humans, then go see Mother...
$F7ui:
Ayla: ......
$F7uk:
ATROPOS: What are you doing Prometheus?
$F7um:
Robos: I won't allow you to hurt them!
$F7uo:
ATROPOS: ......[nl]
   You are indeed defective.[nl]
   They have tampered with you.[nl]
   I'll destroy them, then fix you.
$F7uq:
Robos: Atropos... you've changed.
$F7us:
ATROPOS: Indeed. Mother remade me to eliminate humans more efficiently!
[pause]
   Step back, Prometheus!
$F7uu:
Robos: My name is Robos.
$F7uw:
ATROPOS: Prometheus!!
$F7uy:
Robos: Wait![nl]
   Stand back and leave this to me.

Robos: Atropos...?
$F7v6:
ATROPOS: I'm damaged?[nl]
   What happened?
$F7v8:
Robos: Atropos!!
$F7vA:
ATROPOS: My memory bank...
[pause]
   Mother must have done something nasty when she reprogrammed me...
$F7vC:
Partial memory...restored...[nl]
I'm sorry...Prometheus...
$F7vE:
Lucca: Save your strength![nl]
   I'll patch you up.

               Found 1 [item]!
$FCYG:
The pendant begins to glow...!
$FCYI:
Marle: Eeeek!
$FCYK:
Lucca: Yeoouch...!
$FCYM:
Marle: There's no way the Chancellor can reach us here.
$FCYO:
Marle: But, where are we...?
$FCYQ:
Lucca: The civilization here seems so...advanced...
$FCYS:
Marle: Like we're in another world.
$FCYU:
A strange crest is engraved here.[nl]
It's sealed by some kind of power.
$FCYW:
If you're looking for food, you lose!
$FCYY:
You light up my life...no, really!
$FCYa:
Truce Dome?[nl]
Never heard of it.[nl]
This is Trann Dome.
$FCYc:
What's this?
[pause]
A plant?[nl]
 What's that?
$FCYe:
Kingdom...?[nl]
Whaddaya talking about...?
$FCYg:
Never seen anything like this...
$FCYi:
You'll find some food at Arris Dome to the northeast.[nl]
But only if you get past Lab 16...
[pause]
The beasts there don't react to weapons, like guns and swords.
$FCYk:
So, there are people in Arris Dome, too!
$FCYm:
This is an Enertron.[nl]
You get a full night's sleep in a few seconds, but it still leaves you hungry.
$FCYo:
This edible?...
$FCYq:
Wheeze...pant...
[pause]
Finally got through the ruins. I brought the sapling that sprang from the seed!
[pause]
Amazing what you can do when you think you're gonna expire...
$FCYs:
Will you rest in the Enertron?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCYu:
[nl]
               HP/MP restored!
$FCYw:
[nl]
           But you're still hungry.
$FCYy:
OLD MAN: You there, where're you[nl]
   from?...
$FCZ0:
Lucca: We came from the laboratories to the west.
$FCZ2:
OLD MAN: W, what?!
$FCZ4:
OLD MAN: Hey, we've got people who[nl]
   crossed the ruins!
$FCZ6:
Say again!?
$FCZ8:
You're joking!?
$FCZA:
OLD MAN: So there ARE people who can[nl]
   beat up those freaky mutants...
$FCZC:
OLD MAN: Pardon me.  I'm Doan.[nl]
   I'm the descendant of the Director of this Info center.
[pause]
   In the basement, there's a huge computer and a storage center for food.
[pause]
   But we can't get through 'cause of the robot guards.[nl]
   It's a pity.
$FCZE:
DOAN: Are you going down below?
$FCZG:
Marle: Of course!
$FCZI:
DOAN: But no one's ever returned from there.
$FCZK:
Lucca: Gotta try, right?
$FCZM:
DOAN: ......
[pause]
   It's nice to see such spirited young people for a change.
$FCZO:
DOAN: Careful, now.[nl]
   And come back alive.
$FCZQ:
DOAN: Hey fellas![nl]
   Look![nl]
   The seed's sprouted!
$FCZS:
The door with the crest?[nl]
Dynamite won't budge it.
$FCZU:
There's an old factory site called Proto Dome to the east. Can't get near it 'cause there's a bunch of lunatic robots in the area.
$FCZW:
Since you've come, we've gained the courage to live.
$FCZY:
You can reach the continent to the south through the Sewer Access, but stay off of «Death Peak.
$FCZa:
There's an old man living in a dome near «Death Peak.»[nl]
Talk about crackpots!
$FCZc:
Did you really come from the dome to[nl]
the west?...[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCZe:
I see...[nl]
Not that I really care...
$FCZg:
A time portal?  What in the...?[nl]
Well, guess we can get our own information using our computer!
$FCZi:
Thanks a lot...[nl]
You've given me hope.
$FCZk:
Wonder what kind of fruit this is going to bear?
$FCZm:
Daddy's gonna bring us some food!
$FCZo:
Daddy's on a trip.
$FCZq:
My husband went down to the food storage area below.
[pause]
I haven't seen him since...
$FCZs:
But I haven't given up.[nl]
This child, and this seed are still growing.
$FCZu:
Who are you?
$FCZw:
Hey![nl]
It's those people again!
$FCZy:
Hey![nl]
It's them!
$FCa0:
Lucca: So this is the info center!
$FCa2:
Lucca: Good![nl]
   The computer's still operational![nl]
   If we run a search on time warps, we might find our Gate!
$FCa4:
Lucca: Here![nl]
   Got it!
$FCa6:
Lucca: East of Arris Dome...
$FCa8:
Lucca: That would be Proto Dome, I believe.
$FCaA:
Marle: Leave it to Lucca![nl]
   I'm beginning to think you could find anything with this device!
$FCaC:
Marle: Say, what does this button do?
$FCaE:
Lucca: 1999 A.D.?[nl]
   Visual record of The Day of Lavos...
$FCaG:
Marle: Wh, what...IS that?
$FCaI:
Lucca: Lavos?...[nl]
   Is that what's destroying our world?!
$FCaK:
Marle: We must truly be in the future...
$FCaM:
Marle: No![nl]
   NO WAY![nl]
   I refuse to believe it!!
$FCaO:
Marle: This...
$FCaQ:
Marle: ...this can't be the way the world ends...
$FCaS:
Lucca: ......
$FCaU:
Marle: Crono...
$FCaW:
Marle: There's only one thing we can do![nl]
   We must change history! Just like Crono did when he saved me!
$FCaY:
Marle: Okay, Lucca?
$FCaa:
Marle: Okay, Crono?!!
$FCac:
Lucca: I...guess so...
$FCae:
Lucca: We can't just go back to our world and live comfortably after seeing this...
$FCag:
Lucca: It was a stroke of luck that we were sent here through that Gate.
$FCai:
Lucca: Crono, let's go![nl]
      Okay![nl]
      No...
$FCak:
Lucca: Come on![nl]
   Show Marle what you're made of!
$FCam:
Marle: Crono![nl]
   Lucca![nl]
   Together we can do this!
$FCao:
Lucca: Let's take a second and do some more research on Lavos' activities back in our time period!
$FCaq:
Lucca: Next stop, Proto Dome!
$FCas:
DOAN: You're back!
$FCau:
DOAN: Well?[nl]
   What did you discover?
$FCaw:
Marle: This is...our future!
$FCay:
DOAN: ???
$FCb0:
MAN: Who cares, where's the food?!
$FCb2:
Marle: This is all we could get...
$FCb4:
DOAN: Seeds...?
$FCb6:
Lucca: You don't know how long the Enertron'll hold out.[nl]
   Those seeds might be your only hope.
$FCb8:
Marle: You have to stay alive![nl]
   And so do we!
$FCbA:
DOAN: Huh...
[pause]
   You're strange...[nl]
   You're different from us...
$FCbC:
Marle: I think it's because we're healthy!
$FCbE:
DOAN: Heal-thy?[nl]
   Got a nice ring to it!
[pause]
   We'll try growing the seeds...
$FCbG:
KID: What're those?
$FCbI:
DOAN: They just might be our future...
$FCbK:
DOAN: Heading for Proto Dome?[nl]
   Go by way of Laboratory 32, and take this with ya.
$FCbM:
DOAN: It's a key to the Jet Bike in lab 32.
[pause]
   I used to ride it when I was young.[nl]
   Hope it still works...
$FCbO:
DOAN: They've got more powerful robots over there.[nl]
   Take care, and stay...healthy!
$FCbQ:
My husband...he's...he's...gone...
[pause]
But he left me precious gifts![nl]
The seeds...and our child.
$FCbS:
Daddy's sure taking his time.
$FCbU:
Robos: Where are we?
$FCbW:
OLD MAN: Ah, more guests...!
$FCbY:
Marle: Say...where are we?
$FCba:
Lucca: What do you mean, «guest»...?[nl]
   And, WHERE are we?
$FCbc:
OLD MAN: Why,[nl]
   this is «The End of Time,» of course!
[pause]
   All lost travelers in time wind up here![nl]
   Now, where are you from?
$FCbe:
Lucca: We're from Guardia Kingdom, circa 1000 A.D.
$FCbg:
Robos: I come from 2300 A.D...
$FCbi:
OLD MAN: When 4 or more beings step[nl]
   into a time warp, the Conservation of Time theorem states that they will turn up...
[pause]
   ...at the space-time coordinates of least resistance.[nl]
   Here.
[pause]
   Disturbances in the space-time continuum have increased recently.[nl]
   Far too many folks are just popping in here...
[pause]
   I fear something is having a powerful effect on the very fabric of time...
$FCbk:
Lucca: Which means one of us has to remain here.
$FCbm:
Marle: Stay HERE?[nl]
   ALONE?
$FCbo:
OLD MAN: It is pretty bleak here...
[pause]
   But not to worry.[nl]
   All time periods connect here...
[pause]
   You can visit your friends whenever you wish! But you can never travel in groups greater than 3...
$FCbq:
Robos: So, one of us must stay.
$FCbs:
Lucca: Who'll it be, Crono?
$FCbu:
Marle: Decide, Crono!
$FCbw:
Lucca: Now don't you go getting any ideas, mister!
$FCby:
Robos: Please come for me whenever you need me.
$FCc0:
OLD MAN: You can instantly bring any[nl]
   person here into your party, should the need arise.
$FCc2:
OLD MAN: ...So there you have it.
[pause]
   Don't forget.  Press the Y Button to switch party members.
$FCc4:
Marle: How do we get back to our time?
$FCc6:
OLD MAN: You see those lovely pillars of[nl]
   light? Those hook you up to different eras.
[pause]
   Once you've been through a Gate, you can always use it to come here.
[pause]
   To use a Gate from here, step into the light and press the A Button.[nl]
   But beware the Gate which leads from that bucket...
$FCc8:
OLD MAN: That Gate leads to 1999 A.D...[nl]
   It leads to the «Day of Lavos»...
[pause]
   Go there only if you're looking to achieve a shorter life span...
[pause]
   Lavos will help you leave this mortal coil.
$FCcA:
OLD MAN: Hey.
$FCcC:
OLD MAN: Don't be in such a rush![nl]
   Before you go, take a peek inside the room behind me!
$FCcE:
It's locked shut...
$FCcG:
OLD MAN: Well, well![nl]
   People who lived long ago ALL enjoyed such powers...
[pause]
   Now, I know you are itching to go ripping back and forth through time, but first you need to return to your era.
[pause]
   And you must hurry.[nl]
   The longer you remain here, the harder it will be to change that which must be changed...
[pause]
   Stop by whenever you're in the area!
$FCcI:
OLD MAN: Come see me anytime.[nl]
   Think of me as your guide.
$FCcK:
Will you take Crono?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCcM:
Marle: Take me too!![nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCcO:
Marle: OKAY!
$FCcQ:
Marle: Aw, come on!
$FCcS:
Lucca: Don't you need my brain[nl]
   power?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCcU:
Lucca: See![nl]
   You DO need me!
$FCcW:
Lucca: Oh, get outta here!
$FCcY:
Robos: May I be of assistance?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCca:
Robos: I'm ready, [member1]!
$FCcc:
Robos: I shall be waiting for you.

   swordsman?![nl]

Ayla: Take Ayla, [member1]!

Lucca: Time for action, Epoch!
$FCdO:
Robos: Epoch ready for takeoff!
$FCdQ:
Frog: High ho, Epoch!!
$FCdS:
Ayla: Epoch![nl]
   Go!!
$FCdU:
Magus: Forward...
$FCdW:
Board the Epoch?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCdY:
Got any cash?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCda:
You call this money?[nl]
Oh well, I have some good stuff.
$FCdc:
Got nothing for you fools.
$FCde:
Save money.[nl]
 It'll do ya good.[nl]
That's my motto.
$FCdg:
Have any money?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCdi:
You sure this is money...?[nl]
Oh, well, I have to lighten my inventory anyway.
$FCdk:
I hate wise guys!
$FCdm:
Save money, it'll do you good.
[pause]
It's what that guy who walked to the other dome used to say.
$FCdo:
OLD MAN: Hey, where's that healthy kid[nl]
   with the radical haircut?
$FCdq:
OLD MAN: ...
[pause]
   This is terrible news...
[pause]
   I have nothing to give you but this song.[nl]
    It's called ...
[pause]
   [nl]
         «Memories of Crono»
$FCds:
OLD MAN: I wish I could lend a hand...
$FCdu:
Marle: We're looking for the Guru of Time...
$FCdw:
Magus: Only the Guru of Time can help us now...
$FCdy:
Ayla: Ayla need Guru of Time.[nl]
   Search now!
$FCe0:
Robos: We are looking for the Guru of Time...
$FCe2:
OLD MAN: Hey, where have you been?
$FCe4:
OLD MAN: So that's your story...[nl]
   And just LOOK at you now...[nl]
   You've become quite formidable!
$FCe6:
Magus: Heh?...
$FCe8:
OLD MAN: The Guru of Time, eh...?
[pause]
   Heard of him, of course, but what do you want with him?
$FCeA:
Marle: He knows how to bring Crono back...
$FCeC:
Frog: We've heard he might be the one to bring our Crono back...
$FCeE:
Ayla: He bring [crononick] back to life![nl]
   He strong.
$FCeG:
Lucca: We believe he knows how to bring Crono back to life.
$FCeI:
OLD MAN: To bring back lost loved[nl]
   ones...[nl]
   It's what everyone wants...
[pause]
   Crono must be proud...
[pause]
   ...to have friends like you...
$FCeK:
OLD MAN: Here.[nl]
   Take this with you.
$FCeM:
Ayla: Egg![nl]
   Ayla hungry, want eat!
$FCeO:
Frog: What be this?[nl]
   Me thinks...an egg?
$FCeQ:
Robos: This is...[nl]
   an egg of some sort?
$FCeS:
Lucca: An egg?[nl]
   Is it hardboiled or 3-minute?
$FCeU:
OLD MAN: Let us call that the Chrono[nl]
   Trigger. It is pure potential.
[pause]
   By unleashing a specific course of events, it can have a powerful effect on time.
[pause]
   Ask the one who made the Epoch, your Wings of Time, how to hatch it...
[pause]
   Like any egg, it represents a possibility...[nl]
   It may or may not...hatch.
[pause]
   But the Chrono Trigger gives you the potential to get your friend back...
[pause]
   The egg will have an effect equal to the effort you put into your search.[nl]
   No more, and no less.
[pause]
   Don't forget that.[nl]
   As long as you keep Crono in your heart, the day you are dreaming of shall arrive...
$FCeW:
Magus: I get it...it's you, isn't it...?
$FCeY:
Marle: Wait a sec...
[pause]
   Are YOU Gaspar, the Guru of Time?
$FCea:
Lucca: It's you, isn't it?!...
[pause]
   You're Gaspar, the Guru of Time!
$FCec:
Robos: This can only mean...
[pause]
   ...you are the Guru of Time...[nl]
   Mr. Gaspar, I presume?!
$FCee:
Frog: Wh...what?
[pause]
   So......
[pause]
   Thee art Gaspar, the Guru of Time!
$FCeg:
OLD MAN: Um...well...
[pause]
   ...I believe that's what they used to call me...
[pause]
   ...ages ago...
$FCei:
Lucca: This console controls the passageway.[nl]
   We need a password to get through.
$FCek:
Marle: Crono![nl]
   Let's go get Crono!
$FCem:
Lucca: ...
[pause]
   He was a pain, but now that he's gone...
[pause]
   Now don't go getting any stupid ideas![nl]
   He was like a brother to me!
$FCeo:
Robos: Without Crono, everyone is depressed...
$FCeq:
Frog: That fool...
[pause]
   No one that young is supposed to leave this mortal coil...
$FCes:
Ayla: [crononick] strong![nl]
   Not gone yet![nl]
   Ayla find [crononick]!!
$FCeu:
Magus: Doesn't matter if HE's here or not.
[pause]
   My attention is focused elsewhere...
$FCew:
Marle: I can't believe this![nl]
   I'm so happy!
$FCey:
Lucca: Don't put us through that again!
$FCf0:
Robos: Now that Crono's here, everyone's cheerful!
$FCf2:
Frog: Look at you... Ladies weeping over you right and left...
$FCf4:
Ayla: [crononick]![nl]
   [crononick]!![nl]
   [crononick]!!
$FCf6:
Magus: ...
[pause]
   You got whacked, 'cuz you're weak.
$FCf8:
OLD MAN: So![nl]
   Looks like you were successful!
[pause]
   No, don't thank me. I didn't do a thing. I just gave you a place to begin...
[pause]
   If you really want to thank me, make me a member of your team!
[pause]
   By the way, the Wings of Time has come looking for you.[nl]
   It seems to have a heart and mind of it's own...
$FCfA:
OLD MAN: You wish to fight Lavos,[nl]
   correct?
[pause]
   Many paths lay open to you.[nl]
   You may use that bucket. Or fly the Wings of Time to «The Day of Lavos»...
[pause]
   Or there's the Black Omen, which floats in the sky above your world.[nl]
   Lavos is somehow connected with it.
[pause]
   It's up to you to decide when and where to fight Lavos.
[pause]
   By now you must realize you are the only ones who stand a chance against him...
[pause]
   However, you will not be alone. I have had vague glimpses of events, people and places that will empower you...
$FCfC:
In the Middle Ages, a woman's sheer determination brings a forest back to life...
$FCfE:
A fugitive in the Middle Ages, Ozzie, maintains an evil hideout...
$FCfG:
There's a task to be done in the Future, where machinery originated.
$FCfI:
And there's a very special stone that can shine its light on each generation, from the distant past to the far future...
$FCfK:
There's the ghost of a lofty knight, slain by Magus in the Middle Ages, who haunts the present...
$FCfM:
There's an object in the Middle Ages that sparkles like a rainbow...
$FCfO:
OLD MAN: One of you is close to[nl]
   someone who needs help...[nl]
   Find this person...fast.
[pause]
   Just as you touch the lives of every life form you meet, so, too, will their energy strengthen you.
[pause]
   Fail to live up to your potential, and you will never win...
[pause]
   I am sorry that I must simply witness the coming spectacle from my vantage point here...
$FCfQ:
OLD MAN: That poor woman can finally[nl]
   rest, now that the Black Omen is gone.[nl]
   She's reverted back to a human...
[pause]
   Now it is time for you to access the Gate contained within that bucket!
[pause]
   You fight not just for yourselves, but for all living things...
[pause]
   This is a battle between Lavos and the entire world!
$FCfS:
OLD MAN: Aha![nl]
   So you've been to the Land of Magic...
[pause]
   Now that the pillar of light is sealed, you'll be needing something that will transport you through time.
[pause]
   I recall someone working on such a device.[nl]
   The Wings of Time, I believe he called it.
[pause]
   I'm afraid he became a tad psychotic spending so much of his time doing research.
$FCfU:
OLD MAN: Interesting. So he actually[nl]
   finished the Wings of Time.
[pause]
   In fact, gave his life for it!
[pause]
   Why not put that device to good use?[nl]
   Take it to the ancient Land of Magic!
$FCfW:
OLD MAN: Dreamstone?...
[pause]
   I've heard of it, of course.[nl]
   It's a prehistoric mineral...
[pause]
   You might find it way back in the prehistoric era.
$FCfY:
OLD MAN: You found a Dreamstone![nl]
   I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
[pause]
   You'll need to find someone that can process that mineral. You'll probably find him in Medina, a village near the Mystic Mountains.
$FCfa:
OLD MAN: What luster![nl]
   The Masa...Mune, correct?
[pause]
   A...person in the Middle Ages wants to take down Magus with that.
$FCfc:
OLD MAN: What a strange new guest![nl]
   Are YOU from the Middle Ages?
$FCfe:
GURU GASPAR: Th, this is...
$FCfg:
Hey.
$FCfi:
   Nothing here...[nl]
   This must be...
[pause]
   ...the End of Time...
$FCfk:
Magus: ......
[pause]
   Cretins![nl]
   And they're still alive!?
[pause]
   By the way, Ozzie had a hideout much like my castle...
$FCfm:

[pause]

$FCfo:
Robos: The origin of machines...?
[pause]
   You mean to tell me I have a birthplace?

Frog: The knight spirit which wanders...
[pause]
   It can't be...
$FCfs:
Ayla: Fight Lavos![nl]
   Ayla village have strong defense item![nl]
   Go see!!
$FCfu:
Lucca: Solar energy was used aeons ago, well before Lavos Energy existed...
[pause]
   It might be just the thing we need to defeat Lavos...

$FCgU:
Frog: It's been ages, Sir Slush!...
$FCgW:
SLASH: That's SLASH, you slimy dolt![nl]
   Still playing the comedian, eh Glenn?
[pause]
   You'd be singing a different tune if Cyrus hadn't been there with you last time!
$FCgY:
SLASH: You'd have fit right in with those boney fellows you just busted up!
$FCga:
SLASH: Now, let's get to business.[nl]
   This is going to do me a world of good!
$FCgc:
SLASH: And with no Cyrus to protect you, you're mine!
$FCge:
SLASH: You dare to oppose me?!

$FCh2:

Lucca: Say what?![nl]
   That's a guy?!
$FCh6:
Robos: But its exterior is that of a female...
$FCh8:
FLEA: Male...female......what's the difference?[nl]
   Power is beautiful, and I've got the power!
$FChA:
FLEA: Poor little Froggie! You must be lonely now that Cyrus is gone.
[pause]
   And to be turned into something so hideous![nl]
   Dreadful!
$FChC:
FLEA: But since you've brought your new friends over to play...
$FChE:

Magus: Bad timing...![nl]
   Don't wake up on me now...!
$FCj8:
Marle: Wake up?[nl]
   YOU'RE the one who CREATED him!
$FCjA:
Lucca: What do you mean?![nl]
   Didn't you CREATE him?!
$FCjC:
Robos: What do you mean?[nl]
   According to my records, Lavos was born here, at THIS precise moment...
$FCjE:
Magus: You fools![nl]
   I only «summoned» him!
[pause]
   He lives in the inner earth, absorbing the land's power and growing ever stronger!
$FCjG:
Marle: What?!
$FCjI:
Lucca: So, he wasn't born in this period...

$FCkI:
   What're you lookin' at?
[pause]
   I'm Spekkio.[nl]
   The Master of War![nl]
   I've seen all kinds of battles from here.
$FCkK:
SPEKKIO: How do I look to you guys?[nl]
      Strong![nl]
      Weak!
$FCkM:
SPEKKIO: I see.[nl]
   Let's put it this way.[nl]
   If you're strong, I look strong.[nl]
   If you're weak, I look weak.
$FCkO:
SPEKKIO: You are strong of will...!
[pause]
   That's why the Old One let you through.
[pause]
   Long before you were born...[nl]
   ...there was a kingdom where magic flourished.[nl]
   Everyone there could use it!
[pause]
   But in time, people began to abuse their powers. It got so bad that no one was allowed to use magic except wizards.
[pause]
   But you have it...determination, I mean![nl]
   Magic needs power of the heart.[nl]
   It needs inner strength.
[pause]
   Magic is divided into 4 types:[nl]
   Lightning, Fire, Water, & Shadow.
$FCkQ:
SPEKKIO: You, with the punk hairdo![nl]
   You're «Lightning.»
$FCkS:
SPEKKIO: The one with the ponytail is «Water.»
$FCkU:
SPEKKIO: The one with goofy glasses is «Fire.»
$FCkW:
SPEKKIO: That's the biggest toy I've ever seen...[nl]
   Hey, you're not alive, are you?!
[pause]
   You've got great strength, however, since I can't measure your inner character, I can't give any magic to you.
[pause]
   But your laser weapons will suffice.[nl]
   They can inflict «Shadow» type damage.
$FCkY:
SPEKKIO: Not just magic, but EVERYTHING is based on the balance of these 4 powers.
$FCka:
SPEKKIO: Think «MAGIC,» and, starting from the door, walk clockwise along the walls of my room 3 times.
[pause]
   Don't lose track, now.
$FCkc:
SPEKKIO: No cheating![nl]
   I'm watching!
[pause]
   Do it over! From the door, clockwise along the wall, 3 times!
$FCke:
SPEKKIO: Very good!
$FCkg:
SPEKKIO: Ipso facto, meeny moe...[nl]
           MAGICO!

$FCkm:

$FCko:

$FCkq:

   Wanna try it out?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCks:
SPEKKIO: All right!
$FCku:
SPEKKIO: Hi![nl]
   Looking for some practice?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCkw:
SPEKKIO: Any time, friends.[nl]
   Remember, I'M the Master of War!
$FCky:
SPEKKIO: GRRRR...
[pause]
   That was most embarrassing!
$FCl0:
SPEKKIO: Wait a sec![nl]
   I'M the Master of War!
$FCl2:
SPEKKIO: See, I AM the Master of War![nl]
   Uwahahaha!
$FCl4:
SPEKKIO: Harrumph...[nl]
   Don't make a habit of this.[nl]
   Here, this is for you.
$FCl6:
SPEKKIO: I AM the Master of War![nl]
   Whew! Sometimes I scare myself!
$FCl8:
SPEKKIO: HEHEHEHE!![nl]
   I WIN!
$FClA:
SPEKKIO: You guys are too much![nl]
   Bring newcomers to meet me!
$FClC:
SPEKKIO: What a weird fellow.[nl]
   Being a frog, let's give him «Water!»
$FClE:
Frog learned to use magic!
$FClG:
SPEKKIO: All right![nl]
   Sweetheart!
[pause]
   Unfortunately, you were born before magic existed! But you seem to have other skills that will get you by.
$FClI:
Ayla can't use magic!
$FClK:
SPEKKIO: ...Phew...!!
[pause]
   You hauled in a marlin here, kids!
[pause]
   He can use «Shadow»...[nl]
   And he could probably teach me a thing or two!

$FCoq:
Lucca: Think we can burst through Lavos with the Epoch?
$FCos:
Lucca: We might wreck the Epoch![nl]
   But...we really don't have a choice...

Magus: Finally...[nl]
   You have met your match, Lavos!...
$FCqa:
Marle: It's...humanoid...
[pause]
   It seems like it has collected all of the vitality from the creatures who have lived on this planet.
$FCqc:
Lucca: Now I understand...
[pause]
   It lives on a planet for as long as possible, stealing away the most vital resources...
[pause]
   It combined the DNA it found here with its own, and gave birth to those creatures up on Death Peak.
[pause]
   Eventually the young must migrate to other planets...to repeat the cycle...
$FCqe:
Robos: This was Lavos's goal...!
[pause]
   Using the DNA of every organism...
[pause]
   And achieving the ultimate in evolution!

$FCqq:
Magus: We were created only to be harvested.[nl]
   All people...
[pause]
   ...and all living things...

$FCr6:
You CAN'T expect to toy with an entire world and get away with it!
$FCr8:
Robos: Human hands created me...
[pause]
   Which means I am a product of that thing...I am no different than Lucca and the others...

I am a part of all living things!!

Not part of planet's life!!
$FCrK:
Magus: ......

$FCyQ:
Marle: I'm so relieved you're here!
$FCyS:
Marle: We barely know each other, but somehow, I knew you'd come for me...
$FCyU:
Marle: Thank you, Crono!
$FCyW:
Marle: S, something's wrong!!!
$FCyY:
Marle: W, what's happening?![nl]
   It feels like...I'm being torn apart!
$FCya:
Marle: Help me, Crono![nl]
   I'm scared!!![nl]
    Please... [crononick] ...h, help me!
$FCyc:
...
[pause]
I grow so tired of the gossip around here!
$FCye:
Did you notice anything odd about[nl]
the Queen?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCyg:
Just as I thought![nl]
She claims she's not Leene! There's something...different about her.
[pause]
Don't mention this to anyone!
$FCyi:
Okay, if you say so.
$FCyk:
Has she dismissed you already?[nl]
You were polite, of course?
$FCym:
You didn't do anything...funny, did you?[nl]
      Of course not![nl]
      Well...yes.
$FCyo:
Are you sure?
$FCyq:
Oooh! We can't let this juicy tidbit out of the castle!
$FCys:
Go downstairs if you want to rest.
$FCyu:
The Knight's quarters is downstairs.
$FCyw:
The dining room's below.
$FCyy:
The chef's got a nasty temper, so don't get in his way!
$FCz0:
This dining room is for us soldiers.[nl]
Feel free to grab a bite.
$FCz2:
Magus's troops had better watch out for us!
$FCz4:
The chef's food is great.[nl]
I give it 3 stars.
$FCz6:
I...
[pause]
I'm hungry...
$FCz8:
MAID: Here's your food!
$FCzA:
SOLDIER: All right!
$FCzC:
This is great!
$FCzE:
Hungry? Sit down at the upper left corner of the left table.
$FCzG:
This place is a mini war zone!
$FCzI:
This is no place for kids!
$FCzK:
Wait! Maybe you'd know![nl]
What's this «Eyes Cream» stuff that Queen Leene wants so badly?
$FCzM:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Where's supper?
$FCzO:
WAITRESS: Oh, Captain![nl]
   I'm sorry...
$FCzQ:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: We're fighting a war[nl]
   out there![nl]
   Can't you even keep us fed?
$FCzS:
CHEF: What are you fussing about?[nl]
   You're not the only one who's fighting out there!
$FCzU:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Hey, I don't have time[nl]
   for this.[nl]
   Just feed my men, okay?
$FCzW:
CHEF: Shut your trap![nl]
   I'll decide who's going to get fed, and when!!
$FCzY:
That fool...he thinks HE'S the boss!
$FCza:
The Knight Captain is normally very kind.[nl]
The chef just rubs him the wrong way.
$FCzc:
The Knight Captain is trying hard to fill the shoes of his predecessor, Sir Cyrus, Commander of the Knights.
$FCze:
Those two are brothers. You've heard the expression, «sibling rivalry,» right?
$FCzg:
My husband chose this life because he's a pacifist.
$FCzi:
Zenan Bridge is our last line of defense![nl]
We MUST guard it with our lives!
$FCzk:
So you're the one who helped the Queen.[nl]
Talk to the maid if you need to rest.
$FCzm:
Take a snooze?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCzo:
Refreshed?
$FCzq:
Oh![nl]
If only Sir Cyrus were here!
$FCzs:
You've heard of him, haven't you?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FCzu:
If HE were here, this whole mess with the Queen would never have happened.
$FCzw:
You don't know of Sir Cyrus?![nl]
From which land do you come?[nl]
Or are you simply a fool?
$FCzy:
Sir Cyrus was the Commander of the Knights. His mission was to protect the King and Queen.
[pause]
He and a friend left on a journey 10 years ago.[nl]
No one has heard from them since.
$FD00:
Long ago, a beast called Yakra lurked in the western forest. But after the cathedral was built, Yakra disappeared.[nl]
We're thankful for that.
$FD02:
What a relief, the Queen's been found.[nl]
Now we can concentrate on the war!
$FD04:
Oooohhh...
$FD06:
Magus's troops are strangely quiet...[nl]
Something's about to happen.
$FD08:
Just between us, the Chancellor's been acting VERY strange lately.[nl]
He's been sneakin' out at night...
$FD0A:
Speaking of nut cases, I haven't seen the Queen's guard, that frog-thing, recently.
[pause]
Heard a spell turned him into a frog.[nl]
Do you believe that?[nl]
 I think he's a spy!
$FD0C:
People say the Chancellor's gone crazy, but I don't believe it.
[pause]
The Chancellor's a decent man.[nl]
Why, he goes to the cathedral everyday.
$FD0E:
Crono!
$FD0G:
Lucca:  Huff, puff...you're okay![nl]
   Did you find the girl?
$FD0I:
Lucca: GONE?![nl]
   Whadd'ya mean she's gone?!
$FD0K:
Lucca: Hmm...it's just as I thought.
$FD0M:
Lucca: I knew I recognized her!
$FD0O:
Lucca: And this looks identical to the castle in OUR time!
$FD0Q:
Lucca: I'll bet they mistook that girl for her ancestor...[nl]
   You see, she's a member of the royal family in OUR time!
$FD0S:
Lucca: She's Princess Nadia!
$FD0U:
Lucca: Something must have happened to the Queen in this era.[nl]
   As a result, Princess  Nadia ceases to exists!
$FD0W:
Lucca: Hurry![nl]
   We have to find the real Queen!
$FD0Y:
KING GUARDIA: You had me worried,[nl]
   Leene.
$FD0a:
Frog: I failed to protect Queen Leene.[nl]
   I hath disgraced thee.
$FD0c:
LEENE: Frog!
$FD0e:
LEENE: Your timing was perfect.[nl]
   Who knows what would have happened had you not saved me!
[pause]
   By the way, where is the girl who was mistaken for me?
$FD0g:
Lucca: Oh, yeah![nl]
   I forgot all about Princess Nadia!
$FD0i:
Lucca: Crono![nl]
   Where did Princess Nadia disappear?[nl]
   She may still be there!
$FD0k:
Lucca: Princess Nadia!
$FD0m:
Marle: Huh?[nl]
   What happened?
$FD0o:
Marle: Crono!
$FD0q:
Marle: It was awful...
[pause]
   I can't recall it all...[nl]
   I was somewhere cold, dark...and lonely.
[pause]
   Is that what it's like to...die?
$FD0s:
Lucca: Welcome back, Princess Nadia!
$FD0u:
Marle: You risked your life to help me, too?![nl]
   «Princess...Nadia...?!»
[pause]
   Uh oh...
$FD0w:
Marle: I guess you guys figured it out, huh?
$FD0y:
Marle: Sorry, Crono.[nl]
   I didn't mean to deceive you.
$FD10:
Marle: I'm Princess Nadia.[nl]
   My father's King Guardia the XXXIII.
[pause]
   I really enjoyed being with you at the fair.[nl]
   But if you had known my identity...
$FD12:
Marle: Crono, you wouldn't have[nl]
   shown me around the fair, right![nl]
      Right.[nl]
      Wrong!
$FD14:
Marle: See?[nl]
   I like Marle better than «Princess,» anyway!
$FD16:
Marle: Oh, Crono![nl]
   That's why I like you!
$FD18:
Marle: The real Queen's safe, right?[nl]
   So let's go home, Crono!
$FD1A:
CHANCELLOR: That no good Yakra![nl]
   Impersonating me and kidnapping the Queen!
[pause]
   We MUST create a criminal justice system in this Kingdom to do away with such fiends.
$FD1C:
Wow, you could be Leene's twin!
$FD1E:
Thank you, Crono.[nl]
But...who was that girl we found in the canyon?
$FD1G:
Thank goodness, you're safe!![nl]
You may resemble Leene, but you sure don't act like her!
[pause]
Anyway, you've really helped me.[nl]
Let me know how I can repay you.
$FD1I:
Marle: You're the real Queen Leene, huh?!
$FD1K:
LEENE: You really could be my twin.
$FD1M:
Marle: Well, you two better get along...[nl]
   or I'll be in big trouble.
[pause]
   I'll keep my fingers crossed!
$FD1O:
LEENE: Excuse me?
$FD1Q:
Marle: Um...never mind![nl]
   I guess it's time to go!
$FD1S:
You seem like one of the family, now!
$FD1U:
Frog: 'Twas a fault of mine, which endangered the Queen.
[pause]
   I shall depart for good.
$FD1W:
Marle: Eeeek!
$FD1Y:
Frog: Indeed, your resemblance to the Queen is uncanny.
$FD1a:
Frog: Crono, you hath potential to be a good swordsman!
$FD1c:
Lucca: ...
[pause]
   Froggy, you weren't such a bad guy either.
$FD1e:
KING: Hello![nl]
   You're always welcome here.[nl]
   What can I do for you?
$FD1g:
Marle: Well...
$FD1i:
Lucca: Um, well, it's...
$FD1k:
Robos: We would like to ask a favor...
$FD1m:
Frog: We asketh a favor...
$FD1o:
Ayla: Ayla have favor.
$FD1q:
KING: I get it. You want me to keep that huge shell safe here until the next century, right?
$FD1s:
LEENE: I ask for the sake of [member1].[nl]
   Please carry out their request.
$FD1u:
KING: Done![nl]
   I shall obtain the shell and store it in the castle, as a national treasure.
$FD1w:
Knight Captain!
$FD1y:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Yes, Majesty!
$FD20:
KING: Go and obtain the Rainbow Shell, and bring it back in one piece!
$FD22:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: At once, Sire!
$FD24:
Marle: Thank you, your Majesty![nl]
   And Queen Leene too, of course!
$FD26:
Lucca: Thank you very much!
$FD28:
Robos: Thank you very much!
$FD2A:
Frog: Thanks to thee, from one so humble.
$FD2C:
Ayla: You, good man![nl]
   Strong![nl]
   Ayla like!
$FD2E:
SOLDIER: Oh, it's you again.
$FD2G:
Magus's troops had us cornered but the appearance of the Hero, saved us.
$FD2I:
Hero?[nl]
He just went to see the King a moment ago.
$FD2K:
Sir Crono![nl]
The legendary Hero has finally appeared!
[pause]
He just arrived a moment ago, to meet the King.
$FD2M:
The King was injured, and is recuperating in bed.
$FD2O:
Queen Leene has been at his side all night.
$FD2Q:
The King fought bravely against Magus's troops. Had he not heard of the arrival of the Hero, he might have fought to the death!
$FD2S:
I'm so ashamed...
[pause]
I treated him badly, thinking he was just some brat.
[pause]
Luckily, he forgave me.[nl]
A hero, HE IS.
$FD2U:
At this rate, Queen Leene will also succumb.
$FD2W:
Oh, Crono...[nl]
I've let down my kingdom.
[pause]
Since we cannot locate Cyrus, our sole hope rests on the boy who has the hero medal...
[pause]
He searches the southern continent, for the sword that can defeat Magus.
$FD2Y:
Cyrus must have sent the boy to us.
$FD2a:
The Knight Captain has gone to Zenan Bridge. Many of the wounded from there, are resting below.
$FD2c:
The chef's in a snit, trying to get food to the front lines while keeping the King healthy.
$FD2e:
I'm sorry, the beds are all taken.
$FD2g:
Even the Knight Captain went to the front lines...
$FD2i:
Magus has already defeated 3 fierce warriors.
$FD2k:
There's a food shortage on the front lines.
$FD2m:
Heard something 'bout a hero showing up.
$FD2o:
Argh...
$FD2q:
The King's trying his best, too.[nl]
So snap out of it!
$FD2s:
The wounded just keep piling up.
$FD2u:
Hey, hey, come on now!!
$FD2w:
Hey you, is this food good enough for the King?
$FD2y:
Chef, hurry with the food that goes to Zenan Bridge!
$FD30:
CHEF: What?[nl]
   My brother?![nl]
   He's...
$FD32:
CHEF: That's what you get for thinkin' that you're the only ones fighting for your country!
$FD34:
MAID: Hey!
$FD36:
MAID: Stop bickering![nl]
   Grow up!
$FD38:
CHEF: ...
[pause]
   Pipe down![nl]
   What do you know?!
$FD3A:
Men are such fools!
$FD3C:
He acts that way, but the chef always worries about the Knight Captain.
$FD3E:
Wait!
$FD3G:
CHEF: ...
[pause]
   Take this with you!
$FD3I:
CHEF: And tell that fool...
[pause]
   He had better come back alive!
$FD3K:
You can come and go as you please from now on.
$FD3M:
You sure were lucky, defeating Yakra and all.
$FD3O:
This ought to relieve the King.
$FD3Q:
Leene's presence always brightens things up.
$FD3S:
The King and Queen make such a great couple!
$FD3U:
So... she wasn't Leene after all.
$FD3W:
Which means the real Leene was somewhere else.[nl]
It's exactly as I thought.
$FD3Y:
But you're a dead ringer for her.
$FD3a:
Hmmm.  The more I look at you, the stronger the resemblance...uncanny!
$FD3c:
You guys leaving?[nl]
Wherever you're heading, be careful!
$FD3e:
The REAL Leene?[nl]
Wonderful![nl]
Let's prepare a feast!
$FD3g:
What?![nl]
That wasn't Queen Leene?!
[pause]
And I wasted my time whipping up a batch of that «Eyes Cream» dish she wanted so badly![nl]
Yuck!
$FD3i:
Now the Knight Captain can concentrate on battling Magus's troops.
$FD3k:
Hard to believe she really wasn't Leene...
$FD3m:
Well, Leene would never snack before meals like that other girl did!
$FD3o:
So! That cathedral was at the heart of it all.[nl]
That Frog's done a fine job.
[pause]
But since Magus's troops failed to kidnap Leene, they'll probably be back soon.[nl]
If only Cyrus were here!
$FD3q:
We must crush Magus's troops!
$FD3s:
Heard that Magus's troops put Yakra up to it all.
$FD3u:
Can't believe the cathedral was  their hideout.
$FD3w:
I guess Magus's troops kidnapped Leene.
$FD3y:
Didn't know that a frog could be so brave.
$FD40:
Hmm. I still think there's a conspiracy going on here!
$FD42:
A beast was posing as the Chancellor?[nl]
Well, the fake one had much better taste.
$FD44:
What will you have?[nl]
      Refresh Salad[nl]
      Power Stew[nl]
      Hyper Kabob
$FD46:
Just a sec, okay?
$FD48:
Here you go!
$FD4A:
[nl]
                MP recovered!
$FD4C:
[nl]
                HP recovered!
$FD4E:
[nl]
             HP/MP recovered!
$FD4G:
The chef's stubborn, but he's a good man.
$FD4I:
So![nl]
YOU saved Queen Leene!
$FD4K:
I THOUGHT she ate too much to be our Queen.
$FD4M:
Those two are really looking for a way to make up.
$FD4O:
We've got to nurse the King back to good health!
$FD4Q:
Sorry, I don't have time right now.
$FD4S:
Yo!
[pause]
What?[nl]
You want some Jerky?
[pause]
Sorry, I'm out of the ingredients right now. Besides, it's a tad spicy for most people.
$FD4U:
Y...you're ALIVE!
[pause]
Although we did sustain major casualties, we wouldn't have made it without you!
[pause]
Anyway, we all must work together to rebuild the Kingdom of Guardia!
[pause]
We're all in this together!
$FD4W:
Frog!
[pause]
So, you've teamed up with Crono and the others!
[pause]
You've done a fine job.[nl]
Please remain with us as long as you wish.
$FD4Y:
Crono, my thanks extend for generations to come.
$FD4a:
Nonesense![nl]
YOU saved the day.[nl]
I just cooked!
[pause]
I'm whipping up a victory meal![nl]
Something real fancy!
$FD4c:
We destroyed Magus's troops and we owe it all to Crono.
$FD4e:
Frog, you're magnificent...!
[pause]
I knew you'd do it...[nl]
I was thinking 'bout making you[nl]
«Knight Captain!»
$FD4g:
Frog: I'm afraid 'tis not for me...
$FD4i:
Frog: ...
[pause]
   My heart is glad...thank you, my Liege!
$FD4k:
I don't know how to thank you...
[pause]
Frog![nl]
Where's Frog?
$FD4m:
We've been expecting you![nl]
To the King's chamber, please!
$FD4o:
What a stroke of luck for you guys.[nl]
Defeated Magus, huh?
$FD4q:
Since you didn't come out of Magus's castle, I simply thought...
$FD4s:
If they had broken through at Zenan Bridge, this castle would've been destroyed.
$FD4u:
The injured soldiers have all recovered.
$FD4w:
See, they're all better!
$FD4y:
Please...be
[pause]
...gentle...
$FD50:
I was one of the people you saved at Zenan.
$FD52:
I'm sure Cyrus is smiling, wherever he is.
$FD54:
The chef's experimenting on a great dish.
$FD56:
It's so complicated, who knows when he'll be done!
$FD58:
A great dish needs a great name!
$FD5A:
The Knight Captain and chef have finally made up!
$FD5C:
Frog, thanks again.[nl]
You deserve the title, Knight!
$FD5E:
Frog: Waste not, such precious words on me.
$FD5G:
CHEF: And, this is for you guys.[nl]
   Take it, will ya.
$FD5I:
[nl]
   Sealed with a mysterious energy...
$FD5K:
Something inside is reacting to the[nl]
pendant. Take out what's inside?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.

               Got 1 [item]!
$FD5O:
SOLDIER: Who's there!
$FD5Q:
SOLDIER: Can't let you through.[nl]
   Go check out the festival!
$FD5S:
Princess Nadia!
$FD5U:
CHANCELLOR: Are you all right?[nl]
   Where have you been?!
[pause]
   I heard you were abducted![nl]
   We had soldiers searching for you!
$FD5W:
CHANCELLOR: Scoundrel![nl]
   You're the one, huh?[nl]
   Kidnapping Princess Nadia!
$FD5Y:
Marle: No![nl]
   Crono's...
$FD5a:
CHANCELLOR: Admit it![nl]
   You confused her and tried to take over the throne![nl]
   Terrorist!!
$FD5c:
Marle: S, stop it!
$FD5e:
Marle: Stop this at once!!
$FD5g:
CHANCELLOR: What are you doing!
$FD5i:
SOLDIER: But Princess Nadia said to...
$FD5k:
CHANCELLOR: Idiots![nl]
   Detain him!!
$FD5m:
Marle: Crono!!
$FD5o:
They're escaping!
$FD5q:
Lucca: This doesn't look good!
$FD5s:
Lucca: We have no choice but to break through!
$FD5u:
Stop!
$FD5w:
SOLDIER: Princess Nadia!
$FD5y:
Marle: This is my friend![nl]
   Show him your respect!
$FD60:
SOLDIER: B, but...
$FD62:
Marle: Can't you take orders?
$FD64:
SOLDIER: Of course!
$FD66:
Hold it right there!
$FD68:
CHANCELLOR: Do as King Guardia XXXIII says!
$FD6A:
Marle: Father...
$FD6C:
KING: Silence, Princess Nadia!
[pause]
   The throne comes before your personal wishes!
$FD6E:
Marle: What!?[nl]
   Just because I have a title doesn't mean I'm not a person!
$FD6G:
KING: You pick up strange ideas venturing outside!
$FD6I:
Marle: I didn't «pick up» anything![nl]
   It's called «common sense!»
$FD6K:
KING: Princess Nadia!
$FD6M:
Marle: I despise you![nl]
   I'm leaving!
$FD6O:
CHANCELLOR: Princess Nadia!
$FD6Q:
Marle: Come on, Crono!!
$FD6S:
CHANCELLOR: Don't just stand there![nl]
   After them!
$FD6U:
KING: Princess Nadia...
$FD6W:
You're not going anywhere!
$FD6Y:
It's locked tight...
$FD6a:
Marle: Come on, Crono![nl]
   I don't wanna see that bullheaded fool!
$FD6c:
SOLDIER: !!
[pause]
   T, Terrorists!!
$FD6e:
Lucca: This is NOT good.
$FD6g:
Robos: What is going on?!
$FD6i:
Frog: Who, what?[nl]
   Terrorists?!
$FD6k:
CHANCELLOR: I've been worried, Princess!
[pause]
   I understand your pain.[nl]
   But the king really only cares about his realm...
[pause]
   Yes, even when your mother, Queen Aliza passed away, he worked all day!
$FD6m:
Marle: No one could do that![nl]
   It's inhuman!
$FD6o:
CHANCELLOR: Oh, child, it's ancient history now...
$FD6q:
Marle: Tell me more!
$FD6s:
CHANCELLOR: This may be difficult...
[pause]
   Well, Queen Aliza's condition suddenly changed for the worst.
[pause]
   She desperately wanted to see the king one last time, but he couldn't find the time to drop by...
$FD6u:
CHANCELLOR: Said he had some work to do...
[pause]
   But knowing nothing about death, you waited faithfully by your mother's side...
$FD6w:
CHANCELLOR: Aliza passed away in sorrow...
[pause]
   It's as if the king indirectly killed her... Such a shame...
$FD6y:
Marle: WHAT...!!
[pause]
   Father KILLED?[nl]
   ...MY MOTHER...?!!
$FD70:
CHANCELLOR: But what do I know![nl]
   There are reasons for everything, right dear?
$FD72:
CHANCELLOR: Now...so glad to see you back again.[nl]
   Please go and visit the king.
$FD74:
KING: Oh![nl]
   Nadia...
$FD76:
KING: W, what do you want![nl]
   I'm not giving in to your demands!
$FD78:
Marle: ......
$FD7A:
KING: It's your fault for leaving the castle!
[pause]
   And letting these...hoodlums in here.
[pause]
   You might as well beg for bread on the street corner!
$FD7C:
Marle: Stop it![nl]
   They're my friends!
$FD7E:
KING: They're a disgrace to this family!
$FD7G:
Marle: Father, you, you...
$FD7I:
Marle: You care more about your country than me...or mother!!
$FD7K:
KING: What...?
$FD7M:
Marle: You, ...you killed mother!
$FD7O:
KING: !!
$FD7Q:
KING: Get... OUT OF HERE this instant!!![nl]
   I never want to see your face again!
$FD7S:
Marle: Good riddance!
$FD7U:
KING: We're no longer family![nl]
   Do as you wish!!
$FD7W:
CHANCELLOR: ......
$FD7Y:
Marle: C'mon, let's check out the fair!
$FD7a:
Hey, don't come in here without permission!
$FD7c:
Hey, sorry 'bout that.[nl]
The old lady's handlin' the kitchen.
[pause]
Gotta tread softly around here!
[pause]
The gist of this is that she can cook...but she can yell, too.
$FD7e:
Getting ready for the Millennial Fair.
$FD7g:
The chef's ancestor had a cook-off with Magus's troops.
$FD7i:
Hey!!
$FD7k:
Leave it!
$FD7m:
Oh, dear![nl]
I didn't recognize you, Princess Nadia!
$FD7o:
I'm in charge of the Princess' education!
$FD7q:
I'm in charge of her physical education!
$FD7s:
I'm in charge of discipline.[nl]
And she's missed almost every lesson this year!
$FD7u:
It's you!
[pause]
Where's Princess Nadia?
[pause]
Tell her to return to the castle, please.
$FD7w:
Since it IS our 1000th Anniversary, The King has, for the time being, ordered probation for Crono.
$FD7y:
The King awaits the return of his daughter.
$FD80:
Only the Chancellor thought Crono was guilty.
$FD82:
Without Princess Nadia, this castle's dead.
$FD84:
I, too, hope Princess Nadia returns.
$FD86:
Princess Nadia's a dead ringer for her mother. That's why the King's so strict with her.
$FD88:
We're about to begin celebrating, but with the King like that...
$FD8A:
Due to the King's orders, the court is adjourned.
$FD8C:
Due to the King's orders, the court is adjourned.
$FD8E:
Mr. Pierre awaits downstairs.
$FD8G:
I'm your lawyer, Pierre.[nl]
The King has been so gloomy since Princess Nadia's disappearance...
[pause]
Listening to my story, he has concluded that it was NOT a kidnapping...
[pause]
It's taken time, but I think he understands.
[pause]
Still, the Chancellor's acting weird.[nl]
He may give us some trouble...
$FD8I:
The Chancellor lost it right around the time he ordered that Dragon Tank to be built!
$FD8K:
The Chancellor hired all those soldiers that work in the jail.
$FD8M:
Those jail guardians were an odd bunch.
[pause]
We got cold stares from them.[nl]
It's like they weren't even human!
$FD8O:
I heard the Chancellor really gave it to the King in court.
$FD8Q:
Come, Princess Nadia...
$FD8S:
Oh, woe is me...
$FD8U:
All right, forget it![nl]
Beat it, you guys!!
$FD8W:
......
[pause]
I've got nothing to say!
$FD8Y:
KING: W, what's that?
$FD8a:
Marle: Your... favorite.
$FD8c:
KING: ......
[pause]
   For me?
$FD8e:
KING: Let's see...
$FD8g:
SERVANT: What is it, sir?!
$FD8i:
KING: What...!!
$FD8k:
KING: How dare you...?!
[pause]
   Giving me something this rich when you KNOW I have high cholesterol...!
$FD8m:
Marle: But...it's your favorite!
$FD8o:
KING: This is the last straw![nl]
   Now I know how you REALLY feel!
$FD8q:
Marle: Father, NO...!
$FD8s:
KING: Leave![nl]
   NOW!!!![nl]
   Never show your face here again!!
$FD8u:
Marle: Father!!
$FD8w:
The King does not wish to see anybody.
$FD8y:
If you must know, he's been bedridden since then.[nl]
He's emotionally drained.
$FD90:
Why not give the King a present?
[pause]
He's been known to love jerky...
$FD92:
Jerky?
[pause]
Seems one of his ancestors first made it, but I don't know the recipe.
$FD94:
Urgh...!
[pause]
You'll see, you'll be put on ice!
$FD96:
Oh, my...
[pause]
That Crono, he'll be strung up!
$FD98:
The King is deeply concerned about Princess Nadia.
$FD9A:
But being a King, he keeps it all locked up inside.
$FD9C:
After his wife's death, he only lived for Princess Nadia.
$FD9E:
Cut the foolishness!
$FD9G:
Jeez, I ain't gonna poison the Chancellor.
$FD9I:
I can't get anything done, with you standing around!
$FD9K:
The trial of the century is about to begin.[nl]
Who's, you ask?
[pause]
King Guardia's, of course!
$FD9M:
They say the King sold off the royal treasures.
$FD9O:
The King ordered that the court be locked until the trial's over.
$FD9Q:
Same thing on the left...
[pause]
But weren't there some stairs, over there?
$FD9S:
The decision is about to be handed down.[nl]
The King requests that no one enter or leave.
$FD9U:
It's locked.
$FD9W:
CHANCELLOR: Phew, finally![nl]
   That beast, keepin' me locked up in here...!
$FD9Y:
CHANCELLOR: Princess Nadia![nl]
   Your friends, I presume?
$FD9a:
CHANCELLOR: Wait, I don't have time for this.[nl]
   I must prepare for the Moonlight Parade!
$FD9c:
Sorry, fellas.[nl]
I'm terribly embarrassed...
[pause]
Take care of Princess Nadia, OK?
$FD9e:
The real Chancellor's okay.[nl]
He took off to the Knight's room sayin' he was gettin' ready for the parade!
$FD9g:
Princess Nadia![nl]
At the moonlight parade, you shall receive a lovely present from me!
$FD9i:
Enjoy yourselves at the moonlight parade!
$FD9k:
I'm Pierre, the lawyer.
[pause]
So, like, where's the real chancellor?
$FD9m:
I'm Pierre, the lawyer.
[pause]
I've been planning the Millennial Parade with the Chancellor.
$FD9o:
Now we can go on with the moonlight parade.
$FD9q:
Gonna be a great night.
$FD9s:
The parade's the grand finale.
$FD9u:
It's the kind of parade that brings out the kid in all of us.
$FD9w:
Princess, let's start with P.[nl]
E.!
$FD9y:
It's no game, now !
$FDA0:
No, we MUST start with discipline!
$FDA2:
The soldiers hired by the fake Chancellor were all monsters.
$FDA4:
Now THIS is what I call a 1000th Anniversary.
$FDA6:
No one could tell that the Chancellor was a beast...
$FDA8:
The King's finally feeling better.
$FDAA:
That's great to hear...!
$FDAC:
Come on, now!!
$FDAE:
We owe it all to you![nl]
Eat all you want.
$FDAG:

All right, everyone![nl]
Let's have some fun!
$FTRo:
This bridge is being fixed because Magus's Army trashed it.[nl]
But until Sir Cyrus returns, we'll fight Magus's Army, tooth and nail!
$FTRq:
That frog made it across by swimming to the other side.
$FTRs:
Our food supplies have run out.
$FTRu:
Magus's army is awfully well trained!
$FTRw:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Our rations have run[nl]
   out![nl]
   Have the supplies from Guardia Castle arrived yet?!
$FTRy:
Forming a protective ring around the Hero, the best knights of the Kingdom kicked off the offensive.
$FTS0:
It appears our knights and Magus's troops are locked in battle, at the center of the bridge.[nl]
May we emerge victorious!
$FTS2:
Does the Hero alone have the power to take on Magus's army?
$FTS4:
We cannot defeat Magus's army by ourselves.[nl]
Our only hope is the Hero.
$FTS6:
I never believed those stories about the Hero and his legendary medal...[nl]
Now it turns out he's our only hope.
$FTS8:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Magus's army has[nl]
   the advantage now.[nl]
   Keep back!
$FTSA:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Sir Crono!
[pause]
   Is that for us?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.

   here?!
$FTSI:
Magus's troops have launched an attack![nl]
They're breaking through our defenses!!!
$FTSK:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Stop sniveling! It[nl]
   shames the Knights of the Square Table!
[pause]
    We shall DESTROY Magus's troops and bring honor to our King!
$FTSM:
But, we are far outnumbered!
$FTSO:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: This is our last line of[nl]
   defense.[nl]
   We must let no one through!
$FTSQ:
Understood!
$FTSS:
Aaagh!
$FTSU:
The Hero has made it across the bridge somehow, but our troops have suffered heavy losses.
$FTSW:
Mere mortals can never expect to beat Magus's troops.
$FTSY:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Our troops are[nl]
   suffering greatly.
[pause]
   Sir Crono, will you assist us?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTSa:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: We are eternally in[nl]
   your debt!
[pause]
   You will find Magus's troops across the bridge![nl]
   Take this with you!
$FTSc:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Magus's troops are[nl]
   highly trained.[nl]
   Please be on your guard.
$FTSe:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: I see...[nl]
   We Knights of the Square Table cannot surrender.
[pause]
   We shall hold this position to the last man!
$FTSg:
KNIGHT CAPTAIN: Thanks to Sir[nl]
   Crono, we held the bridge! But, unless we defeat Magus, this is an empty victory.
$FTSi:
We held Zenan Bridge with Sir Crono's help.
$FTSk:
Magus's troops are pretty tame when he's not leading them!
$FTSm:
When Magus left, his troops ran away.
$FTSo:
Marle: Wait up, already!
$FTSq:
Lucca: He's pretty swift when it comes to running away.
$FTSs:
Robos: We've got him.

   You're through!

I'm Ozzie, Magus's top general![nl]

   Give 'em a taste of doom!
$FTT0:
OZZIE: Those wimps're stronger than I thought.
$FTT2:

   But I won't do that twice!
$FTT4:
OZZIE: Drat!
$FTT6:
OZZIE: That's IT![nl]
   Now you're finished!
$FTT8:
Marle: Don't mess with Crono, or you'll really be sorry!
$FTTA:
Lucca: Poor sport, huh?
$FTTC:
Robos: You cannot win.[nl]
   You had best surrender.
$FTTE:

CYRUS: Why don't you join, too?
$FTTM:
GLENN: I...don't think I'd make the cut.
$FTTO:
CYRUS: But, why?[nl]
   You're better with a sword than I am!
$FTTQ:
GLENN: I don't know...[nl]
   I think I'd really lose it if I had to hurt someone.
$FTTS:
MELCHIOR: Ah, hello![nl]
   Could I interest you in a weapon?[nl]
      Yes, I'd like to buy one.[nl]
      No, I'm not interested.
$FTTU:
MELCHIOR: Weapons...[nl]
   If there weren't evil in this world, there would be no need for weapons.
[pause]
   What a sad state of affairs...
$FTTW:
MELCHIOR: Really?[nl]
   Well, you know where to find me should the need arise.
$FTTY:
MELCHIOR: That sword is an invention of mine.[nl]
   It's lightweight and handles superbly.
$FTTa:
MELCHIOR: Should you desire to return to Truce village, use the shortcut through the cave in the mountains to the north.
$FTTc:
Sorry, but I'm out on the road peddling[nl]
my wares. [nl]
Please come back some other time.[nl]
                             Melchior
$FTTe:
Lucca: Say, where's Melchior?
$FTTg:
Lucca: There's a note?[nl]
   What does it say?
$FTTi:
Lucca: What!! The geezer's gone when we need him the most!
$FTTk:
Marle: Hey, looks like Mr. Melchior isn't home!
$FTTm:
Marle: I wonder what this is?[nl]
   Let's see here...
$FTTo:
Marle: He's gone when we need him the most!
$FTTq:
MELCHIOR: You're back again?[nl]
   Come to see my collection?
$FTTs:
MELCHIOR: Th, this sword...it's the Masamune![nl]
   How did you get it?
$FTTu:
Marle: Why would YOUR name be on that sword?
$FTTw:
Lucca: Why would your name be engraved on the sword?
$FTTy:
MELCHIOR: ...
[pause]
   It's a...long story.
$FTU0:
MELCHIOR: You do want to hear this story, right?
$FTU2:
Marle: Yes![nl]
   Tell us about the Masamune!
$FTU4:
Lucca: Of course![nl]
   Tell us about the Masamune!
$FTU6:
Marle: Can you fix it somehow?
$FTU8:
Lucca: Is it possible to reforge it?
$FTUA:
MELCHIOR: Hmmmm...[nl]
   It might be possible if we could get our hands on some Dreamstone, which the sword is made of.
$FTUC:
Marle: Dreamstone?[nl]
    Where can we get that?
$FTUE:
Robos: Dreamstone...?[nl]
    No data in my memory banks of such a rock.
$FTUG:
MELCHIOR: You can't find it anymore.[nl]
   It was a red stone that was once used as money.
[pause]
   Unfortunately, it hasn't been available for a very long time.
$FTUI:
MELCHIOR: I doubt that you'll ever find the red stone, but if you bring some to me, I will fix the Masamune. Keep the sword with you until then.
[pause]
   Would you like to buy something?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTUK:
MELCHIOR: You found some Dreamstone?![nl]
   Then I'll repair the Masamune!
$FTUM:
MELCHIOR: HOW on earth did you get the Masamune...[nl]
   ...and the Dreamstone?
$FTUO:
MELCHIOR: No, don't tell me.[nl]
   I don't think my heart could take it.[nl]
   It'll take a little while to fix this...
$FTUQ:
Lucca: I'll lend a hand!!
$FTUS:
Robos: I shall help also.
$FTUU:
MELCHIOR: Take a good look![nl]
   THIS is the Masamune!
$FTUW:
Marle: Awesome![nl]
   What a weapon!
$FTUY:
Robos: How strange.[nl]
   My sensors are picking up...spiritual energy emanating from the Masamune.
$FTUa:
MELCHIOR: This weapon represents considerable power...[nl]
   Your actions may either save or destroy life.
[pause]
   Wield your sword with full knowledge of the consequences!
[pause]
   Would you like to buy something?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTUc:
Marle: Crono![nl]
   Where are you going?[nl]
   The Masamune isn't fixed yet!
$FTUe:
Lucca: Hey, Crono! Are you just gonna leave the Masamune here?!
$FTUg:
Robos: Mr. Crono, the Masamune has not been fully repaired.
$FTUi:
MELCHIOR: All right, then!
$FTUk:
Lucca: How are you gonna fix it?
$FTUm:
Robos: These repairs seem quite difficult.
$FTUo:
MELCHIOR: Don't interrupt me while I'm conducting research!
$FTUq:
MELCHIOR: At any rate, leave this to me!
$FTUs:
MELCHIOR: To repair the Masamune, we must process the Dreamstone, and activate the sword.
[pause]
   You work on the Dreamstone, and I'll work on the sword.
$FTUu:
Lucca: OK![nl]
   Leave it to Lucca the Great!
$FTUw:
Robos: Understood.
$FTUy:
Lucca: Gonna be mighty busy!
$FTV0:
Robos: First, the tools...
$FTV2:
Lucca: This's pretty complicated...[nl]
   You're breaking my concentration, so would you find somewhere else to go for awhile?
$FTV4:
Robos: Without the proper facilities, refining the Dreamstone could take some time.
$FTV6:
MELCHIOR: To energize this sword, we must first rejuvenate the broken sword...
$FTV8:
MELCHIOR: The spell to energize the sword takes immense concentration.[nl]
   Could you leave us alone for awhile?
$FTVA:
MELCHIOR: All right, it's done![nl]
   Now, bring me the Dreamstone.
$FTVC:
Lucca: I'm done here too.
$FTVE:
MELCHIOR: All right, let's get started.
$FTVG:
MELCHIOR: Sorry to keep you waiting.
$FTVI:
MELCHIOR: Well, I think that's everything.
$FTVK:
Marle: Ok Crono, let's take the Masamune to Frog.
$FTVM:
Robos: Crono, let us take the Masamune to Frog.
$FTVO:
Lucca: Okay, Crono, let's get this back to Frog.
$FTVQ:
Lucca: The Masamune...[nl]
   It's mystic powers might just force me to believe in the supernatural...
$FTVS:
Hey! Did you people just come out of the closet?[nl]
Get outta here!
$FTVU:
You can use magic?![nl]
Magic-using humans supposedly perished long ago.
$FTVW:
Who do you think you are?[nl]
Coming and going out of our closet at all hours.[nl]
Scram!
$FTVY:
Medina village was founded by the ancestors of the Mystics, who lost a war to human beings.
[pause]
Most Mystics hold a grudge against humans.[nl]
Be careful...

$FTVi:
There's an odd man who lives near the cave in the mountains to the west.[nl]
You might enjoy a chat with him.
$FTVk:
Marle: Thanks!
$FTVm:
Lucca: Thanks a lot![nl]
   Say. We were told that Mystics hate humans.[nl]
   Why are you being so kind?
$FTVo:
Robos: Thank you for your help.
$FTVq:
Robos: But why are you being so kind?[nl]
   The Mystics supposedly despise humans.
$FTVs:
Marle: Why are you being so nice?[nl]
   Mystics aren't supposed to get along with humans.

$FTW8:
You're spoilin' my meal![nl]
Scram!
$FTWA:
Nothing here to sell to humans![nl]
Get out of here![nl]
      Give up.[nl]
      Plead.
$FTWC:
You know-it-all humans![nl]
Teach 'em a lesson, boss!
$FTWE:
They got the boss?![nl]
Beasts!
$FTWG:
All right.[nl]
I'll sell something to you.
$FTWI:
Hah! You think I'm gonna cut my prices for a HUMAN?!
$FTWK:
Marle: Crono, what's that weird chanting?
$FTWM:
Lucca: That chanting's pretty creepy![nl]
   What do you make of it?
$FTWO:
Robos: From where does this eerie chanting originate?
$FTWQ:
Oh, great Ozzie[musicsymbol] Ozzie the great[musicsymbol][nl]
He shall rule all[musicsymbol]
$FTWS:
Oh, great Ozzie[musicsymbol] Ozzie the great[musicsymbol][nl]
Ozzie fills our days and nights with joy[musicsymbol]
$FTWU:
As soon as Magus's creation, the mighty Lavos, awakens from his long sleep, the human race is doomed.
$FTWW:
400 years have passed since Magus commanded the Mystics, and waged war against the humans.
[pause]
When Lavos is awakened, all humans are DOOMED![nl]
Mwa ha!
$FTWY:
Long ago, the all mighty Magus brought forth the all-powerful Lavos.
$FTWa:
A beast lives in a cave on the mountain to the west.[nl]
Only magic attacks can harm it.
[pause]
Those who do not possess magic will find it difficult sneak by.[nl]
Well, I better get back to work and tidy up before Ozzie VIII finds me.
$FTWc:
This work is brutal.
$FTWe:
Hut![nl]
Sir Magus
$FTWg:
Hut![nl]
Sir Ozzie...
[pause]
Tut!
$FTWi:
Yeah![nl]
Race ya!
$FTWk:
Hey, wait up!
$FTWm:
Great weather.
$FTWo:
Groovin' on life...
$FTWq:
Hey guys, long time no see![nl]
What's up?
$FTWs:
Gonna run a ferry between Truce and Medina soon.
$FTWu:
Hey there![nl]
How can I help you?
$FTWw:
It's so peaceful.
$FTWy:
Hah! I hope those humans get what they deserve from Heckran![nl]
Ha ha ha.
$FTX0:
I'm Ozzie VIII, Medina village's leader![nl]
My ancestors served the great Magus.
[pause]
Oh, great Magus...why didn't you simply exterminate the human race 400 years ago?
$FTX2:
OZZIE VIII: They still worship Ozzie's[nl]
   statue in the village square.
$FTX4:
OZZIE VIII: Yes sir![nl]
   I take pride in cleaning up.[nl]
   No, I'm not slacking off!
$FTX6:
The name's Bandeau.[nl]
Here to build the ferry between Medina and Truce.
$FTX8:
I'm the leader of Medina.[nl]
Make yourself at home.
$FTXA:
Hey, this stuff's mighty tasty!
$FTXC:
Why do I always get stuck doing this?
$FTXE:
Ozzie VIII uses his ancestors' fame to boss us around!
$FTXG:
Death to the Mystics' enemies!
$FTXI:
Marle: My pendant...?
$FTXK:
Lucca: Your pendant...it's glowing!
$FTXM:
Robos: This glow![nl]
   What is it?
$FTXO:
Frog: A torch comes from the pendant?!
$FTXQ:
Ayla: It shine like star!
$FTXS:
Magus: ...Pendant?
$FTXU:
The seal has been broken.[nl]
I will give you the treasure of the Guru of Reason.
$FTXW:
To the right is a weapon which increases strength.
$FTXY:
To the left is protective gear which will guard your life.
$FTXa:
Choose whichever you feel you need, and take it with you.
$FTXc:
13,000 years was a long time.[nl]
Belthasar, I shall see you shortly...
$FTXe:
[nl]
 It's sealed with a mysterious energy...
$FTXg:
Jump in?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTXi:
If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race!
[pause]
The world would've belonged to us Mystics!
$FTXk:
[nl]
                    GRRRRRR!
$FTXm:
Lucca: In the Middle Ages, Magus created Lavos, the destroyer of this planet's future!
$FTXo:
Marle: In the Middle Ages, Magus created Lavos, who is responsible for destroying this planet's future.
$FTXq:
Marle: If we go to the Middle Ages and take out Magus, can we change history?
$FTXs:
Robos: If we go to the Middle Ages and destroy Magus, can we change history?
$FTXu:
Lucca: We could use the Gate at the Fairgrounds!
$FTXw:
Marle: Hey, Crono, we could use the Gate at the Fairgrounds!
$FTXy:

                Got 1 [item]!
$FTY0:
MELCHIOR: The Black Omen which floats in the sky.[nl]
   ...made by neither the Mystics nor humans...
[pause]
   What does it portend...?
$FTY2:
Oh, the Black Omen, the Black Omen[musicsymbol][nl]
We will smile on the Black Omen[musicsymbol][nl]
Always[musicsymbol]
$FTY4:

$FTZ2:
Ayla: Kino is man... so if Ayla die, Kino chief then.
$FTZ4:
Marle: Ayla...
$FTZ6:
Lucca: Ayla's one tough cookie.
$FTZ8:
Robos: Ayla, you are gentle at heart.
$FTZA:
Ayla: Chase Reptites![nl]
   Get back [crononick] stuff!!
$FTZC:
Reptites come![nl]
Burn village!!
$FTZE:
Those who fight, killed!
$FTZG:
Reptites follow Ayla.[nl]
Ayla bad luck!
$FTZI:
You disobey, so Reptites mad!
$FTZK:
OLD MAN: Ayla...This your fault![nl]
   Look at mess...
$FTZM:
OLD MAN: Reptites followed you![nl]
   So village now ruined!
$FTZO:
Ayla: ... Ayla feel bad.
$FTZQ:
OLD MAN: Reptites strong![nl]
   They live long time before us, they smart so we hide.
[pause]
   But Ayla say fight together...[nl]
   Ayla still fight?!
$FTZS:
Ayla: Ayla fight while alive![nl]
   Win and live. Lose and die.[nl]
   Rule of life.[nl]
   No change rule.
[pause]
   Old man breathe, but dead on inside.
$FTZU:
OLD MAN: Ayla, you strong, can[nl]
   make big talk.[nl]
   We no have power...
$FTZW:
Ayla: No! Have power![nl]
   We fight, gain more power![nl]
   Ayla help you, but need Dactyl.[nl]
   Give Dactyl.
$FTZY:
OLD MAN: Need Dactyl?
$FTZa:
OLD MAN: Go to Tyrano lair?![nl]

   Careful, Ayla!
$FTZg:

$FTZi:
Big ball of fire suddenly appear and burn Reptite's castle.
$FTZk:
Reptites gone![nl]

$FTZm:
Reptites burned.[nl]
Good!
$FTZo:
No more fear.[nl]

$FTZs:
OLD MAN: You![nl]
   Take care Ayla.
$FTZu:
OLD MAN: Reptites gone.[nl]
   Thank Ayla...
$FTZw:
Reptites take Kino![nl]
Reptites hurt all who fight![nl]
What do now?!
$FTZy:
I Forget.[nl]
No need for this stone, so I give to you.
$FTa0:
Who disturbs my slumber?[nl]
Nu...![nl]
Just trying to get some shut eye.
[pause]
I'll change [member1]'s name, so let me get some rest, nu...!
$FTa2:
Sleep well.
$FTa4:
Spend the night?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTa6:
We Earthbound Ones lack magical powers. That's why we were banished from Zeal.
$FTa8:
Our Hero, the Guru of Life, rejected the Queen's plan, so he was banished to the Mountain of Woe.
$FTaA:
It's likely that Dalton came here using the Skyway that Schala created.
$FTaC:
Many inhabitants of this land were taken to build the Ocean Palace, and were never seen again.
$FTaE:
The Gurus of Time and Reason are missing, along with Miss Schala.[nl]
Can no one stop the Queen?
$FTaG:
The Beast's nest is dangerous.[nl]
Better stay away, okay?
$FTaI:
Aaaahhh, Schala...Schala...!!
$FTaK:
This hole leads to the Beast's nest.[nl]
Through the nest you'll reach the place of chains, which anchors the Mountain of Woe.
$FTaM:
This is Algetty, the village of the Earthbound Ones.
$FTaO:
The Queen put the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace to absorb Lavos's energy.[nl]
Is that safe?
[pause]
She locked the Guru of Life up on the Mountain of Woe for opposing her.[nl]
The situation's hopeless.
$FTaQ:
OLD MAN: The Guru of Life said that Sir[nl]
   Janus has stronger powers than even Miss Schala!
[pause]
   Janus must be using her and the Queen to get to Lavos...
$FTaS:
Long ago, the Enlightened Ones and the Earthbound Ones lived as one.
$FTaU:
Now, only the 3 Gurus and Miss Schala treat us as equals.
$FTaW:
I wonder when Miss Schala's gonna come and play with us?
$FTaY:
Wanna buy something?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTaa:
You can't pass through here!
$FTac:
Marle: The Guru of Life's trapped in here.
$FTae:
Lucca: The Guru of Life's trapped in here.
$FTag:
Robos: Here we will find the Guru of Life!
$FTai:
Frog: Ah, 'tis where the Guru of Life remains imprisoned.
$FTak:
Ayla: This big cage?
$FTam:
Marle: Look![nl]
   It's disappearing!
$FTao:
Lucca: It's disappearing!
$FTaq:
Robos: What's happening?!
$FTas:
Frog: 'Tis disappearing!
$FTau:
Ayla: [crononick]![nl]
   Look!!
$FTaw:
Marle: M, Melchior?!
$FTay:
Lucca: Melchior?!
$FTb0:
Robos: Mr. Melchior?
$FTb2:
Frog: Old man Melchior!?
$FTb4:
Ayla: Melchior?
$FTb6:
MELCHIOR: Indeed, I am Melchior.[nl]
   Have we...met before?
[pause]
   More importantly, can you tell me anything about the Ocean Palace?
$FTb8:
MELCHIOR: I see...the Queen has degenerated to that degree...
$FTbA:
MELCHIOR: The more energy the Mammon Machine absorbs, the further the Queen degenerates.
[pause]
   Her spirit has been stolen by the infamous immortal, Lavos.
$FTbC:
MELCHIOR: We must flee![nl]
   The seal has been broken![nl]
   The mountain will collapse!
$FTbE:
MELCHIOR: Lavos sleeps deep underground, while consuming the energy of this planet.
[pause]
   If the Mammon Machine is brought closer to him, he may awaken!
$FTbG:
MELCHIOR: We must hurry before it's too late!
$FTbI:
Elder![nl]
Schala is here!
$FTbK:
MELCHIOR: What?[nl]
   Schala's here?
$FTbM:
Why don't we keep it right there...
$FTbO:
JANUS: What a filthy hovel.
$FTbQ:
ELDER: Miss Schala...why have you come to such a miserable place?
$FTbS:
SCHALA: Stop degrading yourselves![nl]
   We Enlightened Ones were once the same as you.
[pause]
   The only difference is that we are under Lavos's control...
$FTbU:
SCHALA: Melchior...[nl]
   After the Mountain of Woe fell, I thought I would find you here!
[pause]
MELCHIOR: Is it safe for you to leave the palace?
$FTbW:
SCHALA: That no longer matters![nl]
   The Ocean Palace is now operational!
$FTbY:
MELCHIOR: Then all is lost!
$FTba:
SCHALA: But without me, the Mammon Machine won't work.[nl]
   I have turned my back on that evil device!
$FTbc:
SCHALA: I've kept the Skyway open.[nl]
   Hurry![nl]
   You must stop...my mother!
$FTbe:
SCHALA: Dalton!
[pause]
DALTON: Tisk, tisk my dear.[nl]
   Your presence is required elsewhere!
$FTbg:
MELCHIOR: Dalton![nl]
   Leave her alone!
$FTbi:
DALTON: Ah![nl]
   The geezer speaks!
$FTbk:
DALTON: Silence, old man!
$FTbm:
MELCHIOR: Argh!
$FTbo:
DALTON: You'll come to the Ocean Palace with me.[nl]
   Do anything funny, and Schala's dust.[nl]
   Got it?
$FTbq:
JANUS: Schala!
$FTbs:
DALTON: The Queen's children all seem to have a problem with authority, don't they?
$FTbu:
DALTON: Stay back.[nl]
   The life of this woman means nothing to me!
$FTbw:
DALTON: Shall we get going, Schala, dear?[nl]
   Your mother awaits!
$FTby:
Marle: Melchior!
$FTc0:
Lucca: Melchior!
$FTc2:
Robos: Mr. Melchior!
$FTc4:
Frog: Melchior!
$FTc6:
Ayla: Old man.[nl]
   Okay?!
$FTc8:
MELCHIOR: I'm all right.
$FTcA:
MELCHIOR: But we must save Schala, or else...
$FTcC:
OLD MAN: Impossible![nl]
   Even though it's coming from YOU, Melchior...
$FTcE:
MELCHIOR: If the Queen is allowed to fulfill her scheme, all life as we know it, is doomed!
$FTcG:
MELCHIOR: You're willing to challenge the Queen?
$FTcI:
MELCHIOR: You've done so much for us...[nl]
   ...and I don't even know your names!
$FTcK:
Marle: You'll find out soon enough!
$FTcM:
Lucca: That's OK.[nl]
   Someday, maybe we'll need your help!
$FTcO:
Robos: You've already helped us.[nl]
   Let us return the favor.
$FTcQ:
Frog: Worry not thine head.[nl]
   Thou hath fixed the Masamune!
$FTcS:
Ayla: Gramps use red stone.[nl]
   Help [crononick].[nl]
   Now, Ayla help you.
$FTcU:
MELCHIOR: What ARE you talking about?
$FTcW:
Marle: Crono![nl]
   Let's get going!
$FTcY:
Lucca: Come on, Crono!
$FTca:
Robos: Crono, let us hurry!
$FTcc:
Frog: Crono, let us be on our way!
$FTce:
Ayla: [crononick]![nl]
   We go now.
$FTcg:
MELCHIOR: Wait, take this with you.
$FTci:
MELCHIOR: It's made from the same red stone as the Mammon Machine.[nl]
   With it, you can destroy the Machine!
$FTck:
Elder! The Mountain of Woe is about to crumble!!
$FTcm:
Mommy, the mountain's gonna fall!
$FTco:
ELDER: Schala's been abducted.[nl]
   But without sorcery, we can't do a thing.
$FTcq:
Sir Janus is headed toward the Skyway to save Miss Schala!
$FTcs:
Is Miss Schala alive?
$FTcu:
Use the Skyway to chase Dalton.[nl]
And please hurry, for Schala's sake!
$FTcw:
How could something like this happen?
$FTcy:
So it was the Enlightened Ones!
$FTd0:
Miss Schala, where have you gone?
$FTd2:
A tidal wave![delay 07]   [delay 00]
$FTd4:
OZZIE: Come on in![nl]
   This's the Great Ozzie's place.

Magus: You're doing well, Ozzie!

OZZIE: The nerve![nl]
   Deserting your fellow Mystics to serve these humans![nl]
   You're a traitor! You're not our King!
$FTdI:
OZZIE: Why did you desert us?
$FTdK:
FLEA: Oh great Ozzie, stand back, and let ME take care of these cretins.
$FTdM:
OZZIE: Howdy!
$FTdO:
OZZIE: You're nothing but common thieves!

   Anyone who tries to steal my treasure is looking for a VERY cruel death!
$FTdQ:
OZZIE: And away we go!
$FTdS:
OZZIE: Oz...
$FTdU:
Ozzie's in a pickle!!!

OZZIE: You pesky, low down, good for nothings!

OZZIE: Slash!!
$FTdc:
FLEA: You sent for me?
$FTde:
FLEA: Well, if it isn't Sir Magus.[nl]
   Who'd you bribe to get in here?[nl]
   Traitors like you deserve a beating.
$FTdg:
FLEA: Long time no see.[nl]
   You know, I REALLY don't like you.
$FTdi:
OZZIE: I'm counting on you, Flea!
$FTdk:
FLEA: Get ready for a SLAPPING good time...get it?!

   Just you wait![nl]
   We'll teach you a lesson!

   Well, how about a good thrashing!

OZZIE: Slash, don't let me down!

OZZIE: What in the...!
$FTdw:
Ozzie's stumped!

SLASH: Beat me once, shame on you![nl]
   Beat me twice, shame on me.[nl]
   Grrr...
$FTe0:
SLASH: At first I really didn't want to slice and dice ya, but now it sounds kind of fun!
$FTe2:
SLASH: Ready?
$FTe4:
SLASH: Ouch!
$FTe6:
OZZIE: Come on, sweethearts!

OZZIE: Magus![nl]
   You lied when you said you wanted to create a world of evil![nl]
   You used me!
[pause]
Magus: Oh, how dreadful.[nl]
   Say, can you hear that?[nl]
   It's the sound of the Reaper...

Magus: The past is dead.[nl]
   It was all just a dream...

   You will NEVER defeat me!

[nl]
        Cyrus sleeps here,[nl]
   avenged by his friend Glenn.
$FTgw:
Robos: He is resisting my attacks!
$FTgy:
Ayla: It's like rock!
$FTh0:
Lucca: What kind of shield IS THAT?!
$FTh2:
Frog: My sword hath no effect!
$FTh4:

$FTh6:
Frog: Cyrus...
$FTh8:
Magus: ...
$FThA:
Frog: Cyrus?![nl]
   'Tis me, Glenn!!
$FThC:
...Wh...what
[pause]
[nl]
G...l...e...n...n?
$FThE:
Frog: Cyrus. I hath returned.
[pause]
   I shall honor my promise to thee!
$FThG:
CYRUS: Glenn...
[pause]
   Thank you...for making the journey here.
$FThI:
Frog: Dear Cyrus...
[pause]
   Thou must...think ill of me.
$FThK:
CYRUS: On the contrary![nl]
   You have come far, my friend.
[pause]
   When Magus defeated me, I thought of all those whom I had left behind.
[pause]
   King Guardia, Queen Leene, and of course, you...
$FThM:
CYRUS: Your skill and dedication is superior!
[pause]
   I can rest now, knowing that everyone is in good hands.
[pause]
   Good bye, my friend!
$FThO:
Frog: Cyrus, wait![nl]
   I...
[pause]
   I...!
$FThQ:
CYRUS: The Queen...[nl]
   Look after Queen Leene.
[pause]
   Alas, and...farewell...G...le...n...n...
$FThS:
Frog: Cyyyruuus!!!
$FThU:
Frog: I'm so sorry, Cyrus.
$FThW:
Frog: !?
$FThY:
Frog: The Masamune?!
$FTha:
Frog: 'Tis flowing with strength and vigor.
$FThc:
Heh heh
[pause]
That's it!
$FThe:
MUNE: That was special!
[pause]
MASA: Quite. I guess it means that a Hero's power comes from within.
[pause]
MUNE: Mucho metaphysical, man.
[pause]
MASA: Like, MIND over matter, Mune!
$FThg:
Frog: My... mind?
$FThi:
MUNE: Now for a yummy, full-on test!
$FThk:
MASA: It's thrashin' time!
$FThm:
Frog: Ahh![nl]
   'Tis the true identity of the Masamune!!
$FTho:
Frog: Cyrus, I promise to fulfill your wishes!
$FThq:
Frog: 'Tis a sad farewell!
$FThs:
Frog: Onward, all!
$FThu:
There's an old structure to the north.[nl]
It's been in ruins for ages.
$FThw:
A Hero's grave is to the north.[nl]
400 years ago, the knight Cyrus fell while protecting our Kingdom from Magus.
$FThy:
I'd stay away from the ruins![nl]
The structural damage is severe.
$FTi0:
The tale of Glenn, Cyrus and Magus is known to all.
$FTi2:
Ghosts lurk in the ruins.
$FTi4:
I'm bored...[nl]
Maybe I'll check out the Millennial Fair!
$FTi6:
They say some brain-dead ghost hangs out in the ruins to the north.
$FTi8:
Scary!
$FTiA:
Spirits, still attached to the real world, live in places like that.
$FTiC:
A peaceful world is a boring world...
$FTiE:
The anguish of tormented spirits has created a negative energy that surrounds the ruins.
$FTiG:
Cyrus, our town's guardian angel, rests in a grave to the north.
$FTiI:
Toma's off to find the Rainbow Shell.
$FTiK:
The adventurer Toma's grave is on the western cape.[nl]
He only failed to find the Rainbow Shell.
$FTiM:
10G a night.[nl]
Will you stay?[nl]
      Yes[nl]
      No
$FTiO:
Not enough money.
$FTiQ:
Come on in!
$FTiS:
Not a single sale![nl]
And I came all the way from Porre.
[pause]
You, will you please buy something ?
$FTiU:
All the young 'uns went to the Millennial Fair.[nl]
Kids are just gluttons for fun.
$FTiW:
10 years ago a beast was seen carrying something into the Northern Ruins.[nl]
Treasure, perhaps?!
$FTiY:
There's something eerie about the Northern Ruins.
$FTia:
Sir Cyrus, a Knight of the Square Table, is buried north of here.
$FTic:
Cyrus's grave is up north.[nl]
It's a great place for a picnic!
$FTie:
Heard about the ghost?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTig:
Oh?[nl]
Then beat it!
$FTii:
A Ghost Knight roams the Northern Ruins!
[pause]
Isn't that a trip?
$FTik:
Hey, do you know the story about[nl]
Cyrus and his best friend?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTim:
Cyrus's best friend, Glenn, used a legendary sword to beat the Magus's troops.
$FTio:
I wish Toma would stay put for a change.
$FTiq:
I wonder where Toma's off to now?
$FTis:
Hey, bring some more soda!
$FTiu:
Sir, I think you've had enough sugar today.
$FTiw:
Pipe down![nl]
I'll tell you when I've had enough![nl]
Can't you see I love soda pop?
$FTiy:
Nothing like soda pop to quench your thirst!
$FTj0:
You wanna borrow my tools?
[pause]
Be my guest![nl]
I'm busy here, so go get them from my wife.
$FTj2:
Huh?[nl]
When do I work?[nl]
That's none of your business!
$FTj4:
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a carpenter, just like daddy!
$FTj6:
My husband's never around![nl]
I'm gonna show him who's BOSS.[nl]
Next time, POW, right in the kisser!
$FTj8:
What?[nl]
His tools?[nl]
Oh, hold on, they're right here.
$FTjA:
Careful with 'em.
$FTjC:
My tools have been stolen![nl]
I can't get any work done now.
$FTjE:
You've got some tools there.
[pause]
Will you lend them to a buddy?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FTjG:
Thanks a lot.[nl]
Now I can get to work!
$FTjI:
Sigh...
$FTjK:
Thanks for lending me those tools.[nl]
Now I can finally get to work!
[pause]
I guess I'll start with the ruins!
$FTjM:
C'mon, you lazy blokes!
[pause]
Whatever you say boss!
$FTjO:
You want the Northern Ruins repaired?[nl]
It'll cost you 2000 G.[nl]
      Yes[nl]
      No
$FTjQ:
It ain't gonna happen without the cash.
$FTjS:
We can't repair the spots where the monsters hide.[nl]
Call us after you get rid of them.[nl]
We'll do the rest.
$FTjU:
That's it for now.
$FTjW:
We're done for now.
$FTjY:
We're only trainees.
$FTja:
The boss is at his favorite cafe.
$FTjc:
TOMA: Hey [member1], I've finally got a lead on the Rainbow Shell.
[pause]
   But there's something odd going on...[nl]
   Oh, can you hang on to this for me?
$FTje:
TOMA: If I don't return, come to my grave and pour this on my headstone.
[pause]
   Gee, isn't this morbid?
$FTjg:
   The Great Adventurer[nl]
   Toma Levine rests here...[nl]
             3/6/634
$FTji:
TOMA: [member1], long time no see.
[pause]
   I've located the Rainbow Shell.
$FTjk:
TOMA: To the northwest of this cape is a large island called the Giant's Claw.[nl]
   You can find the Shell there.
$FTjm:
TOMA: But beware![nl]
   There are many beasts about!
$FTjo:
TOMA: Time to shove off.
$FTjq:
TOMA: You guys are a riot a minute!
[pause]
   See ya!
$FTjs:
TOMA: So, [member1], you beat me to the Rainbow Shell?
[pause]
   Nah, I'm not sour about it. I probably couldn't have handled the monsters...
[pause]
   But I WILL find the Sun Stone first!
$FTju:
TOMA XIII: Ancient scrolls tell us that if[nl]
   you combine the Rainbow Shell with a Sun Stone, you can make a fearsome weapon!
$FTjw:
FIONA: My husband Marco hasn't returned from the war.
[pause]
   But these woods mean a lot to us, so I'll guard them until he returns.
$FTjy:
FIONA: Many trees were destroyed in the war with the Magus's Army.
[pause]
   I try to maintain the forest by replanting trees, but they all die.
$FTk0:
FIONA: The desert monsters are draining the life out of the soil here.
$FTk2:
FIONA: This Mystic seedling could revive the forest, but I can't plant it. Too many hungry monsters lurking about.
$FTk4:
FIONA: My husband Marco is finally home!
[pause]
   I...I'm so relieved!
$FTk6:
MARCO: Don't worry.[nl]
   I'm home for good.
$FTk8:
MARCO: The monsters in the desert cave hate water.[nl]
   But I can't defeat them by myself.
$FTkA:
MARCO: You killed the monsters?![nl]
   How can I ever thank you?
$FTkC:
MARCO: The war with the Mystics is over, but the battle to revive the forest is just beginning.
$FTkE:
FIONA: Thank you for routing the beasts![nl]
   Unfortunately, it'll take centuries to revive the forest.
[pause]
   I wish I could live long enough to see my wish come true!
$FTkG:
Robos: You can come for me when the job is done.
[pause]
   May I stay behind and help Fiona?[nl]
      Alright[nl]
      No
$FTkI:
FIONA: With Robos's help, it seems my dream may finally come true.[nl]
   How can I ever thank you?
$FTkK:
This is Fiona's Shrine.[nl]
Here we give thanks to Fiona & Robos for replanting the forest 400 years ago!
$FTkM:
The remains of the lofty Robos are enshrined in the inner sanctum.
$FTkO:
Robos: Systems reactivated.[nl]
   Wh, where am I?
$FTkQ:
Robos: Ahh...
[pause]
   [member1], how nice to see you.
[pause]
   For you, it was a quick hop, but for me 400 long years have passed.
[pause]
   The effort was worth it![nl]
   The forest has grown back!
[pause]
   Now, let us celebrate our 400th year reunion.
$FTkS:
Marle: What was that?
$FTkU:
Lucca: Some tremor?
$FTkW:
Robos: An unforeseen earthquake perhaps?
$FTkY:
Frog: What, be this?
$FTka:
Ayla: Ground shaking!
$FTkc:
Magus: ...?
$FTke:
Marle: So that's the monster responsible for this desert!
$FTkg:
Lucca: The monsters are creating a desert here.
$FTki:
Robos: The monsters are causing the desertification here.
$FTkk:
Frog: So, THEY changeth the forest into the desert!
$FTkm:
Ayla: They make forest into desert!
$FTko:
Magus: Retinite...[nl]
   He's behind this new desert.
$FTkq:
Marle: But how can one find a monster that roams the inner earth?
$FTks:
Lucca: It will be hard to defeat a monster that travels underground!
$FTku:
Robos: But monsters that travel underground are impossible to find!
$FTkw:
Frog: How to slayeth monsters within the earth...[nl]
   'Tis a very difficult task.
$FTky:
Ayla: Hard to find monster in earth!
$FTl0:
Magus: ...What a pain...
$FTl2:
Marle: At least Fiona will be happy!
$FTl4:
Lucca: We've neutralized the source of this desert.[nl]
   We should tell Fiona.
$FTl6:
Robos: Now, the desertification should stop.[nl]
   Let us inform Fiona.
$FTl8:
Frog: It be settled then.[nl]
   Let us inform Fiona.
$FTlA:
Ayla: Bad bones gone.[nl]
   Fiona happy now.
$FTlC:
Magus: Hmph!
$FTlE:
Here's a hat made from a magical bough filled with mystical forest powers.
$FTlG:
We are immortal![nl]
We shall live forever with Lavos, who devours this planet even as he sleeps.
$FTlI:
Draining this planet's power, Lavos will rule the world in a mere 14,000 years.
$FTlK:
Within 1,400 years he will emerge to become ruler of this world!
$FTlM:
Within 999 years he'll become the ruler of this world.
$FTlO:
Know this![nl]
The mighty Lavos reigns here!
$FTlQ:
The Black Omen is a path which leads to Lavos.
[pause]
It is a shrine which provides us with limitless power.[nl]
As long as the mighty one reigns, your dreams are hopeless!
$FTlS:
You should sacrifice yourself to the mighty Lavos![nl]
HAAhahahaha!
$FTlU:
Fools![nl]
Haven't you learned your lesson?!
$FTlW:
Return to Epoch?[nl]
      Yes[nl]
      No
$FTlY:
You cretins...
[pause]
I plan to live with Lavos, and control the universe forever.[nl]
You will not get in my way!
$FTla:
Magus: Zeal...[nl]
   A pitiful woman, duped by Lavos!
$FTlc:
Magus: I, myself, will bring an end to all of this!
$FTle:
Indulge in such regrets in the next life!
$FTlg:
Mwa, ha, ha...
[pause]
At last, Lavos awakens!
[pause]
Compared with him, you are like germs.[nl]
But, I...I shall obtain immortality!
$FTli:
Prophet! You are doomed.[nl]
I haven't forgotten what you did at the Ocean Palace.
$FTlk:
You will now forfeit your life.
$FTlm:
How dare you insects come after ME!
$FTlo:
Oh almighty Lavos, lend me your power!
$FTlq:
Magus: Idiots...[nl]
   Nothing can live forever.
$FTls:
Relax, poor creatures...[nl]
The Mighty Lavos has already consumed this world's life energy!
$FTlu:
[nl]
               It's shut tight...
$FTlw:
Great weather today.
$FTly:
The Black Omen sparkles in the sun![nl]
Tomorrow should be clear, too.

   What irony!
$FrXQ:
Mom said I can't play outside 'cause of the monsters.
[pause]
I'm so bored!
$FrXS:
I heard Magus knows arcane magic which the monsters can't match.
$FrXU:
Magus survived, and is in hiding.
[pause]
We can't let him escape![nl]
Think of all the soldiers that fell...
$FrXW:
The chief of Sandorino Village lives here.
[pause]
Are you foreigners?[nl]
Did you flee from Magus's troops?
$FrXY:
The chief of Sandorino lives here.[nl]
Finally, we'll have some peace!
$FrXa:
Magus has 3 fearsome henchmen, Ozzie, Flea, and Slash.

They're tone-deaf, evil fiends!

Magus's 3 henchmen ran off and are hiding on some island.

Will we never get rid of those evildoers?

Magus's lair is on an island to the east.[nl]
Sheer cliffs make it inaccessible.

TOMA: With that settled, I'll grab a bite before I go.
$FrXu:
TOMA: I'm busy right now.[nl]
   Let's talk later.
$FrXw:
CHIEF: We can use the «Rainbow Shell»[nl]
   to make some reflective armor.[nl]
   It'll be strong against magic!
[pause]
   But that guy's a little flakey...[nl]
   Was it a mistake to trust him?
$FrXy:
CHIEF: That liar![nl]
   He's a no good, useless...
[pause]
   He took the money but can't find what I asked for![nl]
   I've been duped!
$FrY0:
Helloooo there![nl]
This is the R & R hotel.[nl]
It'll cost you 50 G![nl]
Well?
$FrY2:
Will you stay?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FrY4:
Oh yes![nl]
Well then rest and relax!
$FrY6:
Huh?[nl]
You don't have enough!
$FrY8:
What a shame![nl]
I'll wait for you to come back...
$FrYA:
Are Magus's armies really closing in?
[pause]
Well, the mythical Hero has appeared so we'll be all right!
$FrYC:
Did you know? They say the mythical Masamune lies deep within the Denadoro mountains.
[pause]
But it's guarded by terrible beasts.
$FrYE:
Want to hear my tale?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FrYG:
Goblins with huge hammers, roam the Denadoro Mountains to the east.
[pause]
But burn their weapons, and they're pussycats.
$FrYI:
Well...I'll tell someone else...
$FrYK:
The famous Denadoro Mountain winds have grown mild.
$FrYM:
Have you met the Hero already?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FrYO:
Wow! I wish I could just get a glimpse of him...[nl]
I've got butterflies!
$FrYQ:
I haven't met him either.
[pause]
I wonder what the champion of the world looks like?[nl]
I'm so excited!
$FrYS:
Clear your conscience, the end of the world is coming.
$FrYU:
We're saved![nl]
At least for now...
$FrYW:
A sword called the[nl]
«something-or-other mune» was made hundreds of years ago.
[pause]
No one has the skill to make a sword like that anymore.
$FrYY:
OWNER: You're looking for the Hero?[nl]
   Go south, to the village of Porre, where they say he's from.
$FrYa:
OWNER: Last I heard, the Hero went to the Denadoro Mountains to find a sword.
[pause]
   I hope he's okay!
$FrYc:
OWNER: Hah![nl]
   Magus is gone!
[pause]
   Now there's nothing to fear![nl]
   Let's have a party!
$FrYe:
Many people go to the inn.[nl]
If you seek someone, ask there.
[pause]
By the way, EnergyWhirls will dissipate if you use your «Slash» attack.
[pause]
There's balance in nature.
$FrYg:
Magus is trying to bring forth an immense evil...
[pause]
If he succeeds, there will be nowhere to run.[nl]
We'll all perish!
[pause]
That's why I'm living it up now!
$FrYi:
They stopped Magus.
[pause]
Now that it's safe I'm enjoying my lemonade![nl]
Vitamin C builds strong bodies!
$FrYk:
TOMA: Hey, how have you been?[nl]
   You pay my tab and I'll let you in on some stuff.
$FrYm:
How about it?[nl]
      Sure.[nl]
      No way.
$FrYo:
TOMA: Thanks a bunch!
$FrYq:
TOMA: Tsk![nl]
   Not enough money!
$FrYs:
TOMA: Hey, one more, please!
$FrYu:
TOMA: Some creepy, dangerous frogs have taken over the southern woods.
$FrYw:
TOMA: Fine![nl]
   Go away, I don't have time for you.
$FrYy:
TOMA: Now for that «Rainbow Shell»...[nl]
   I guess Porre would be the first place to look.
$FrZ0:
TOMA: How have you been, [member1]?[nl]
   I kept my promise and found it!
$FrZ2:
TOMA: When next we meet, I'll have some good news for you.[nl]
   Heh heh...
$FrZ4:
Stop it you dog!
$FrZ6:
SIGN: Private Property.[nl]
   No trespassing...GRIBBIT
$FrZ8:
Who's there!?
$FrZA:
Frog: 'Tis thee, Crono![nl]
   Thou art here to practice thy skill in swordplay?
$FrZC:
Frog: What?![nl]
   The King hast been injured?
$FrZE:
Frog: ......
[pause]
   I see...
$FrZG:
Frog: 'Tis nary a thing I canst do...[nl]
   Please be on thy way.
$FrZI:
Frog: The Hero, I am not.[nl]
   I can do naught.
$FrZK:
Frog: Thee hath returned?[nl]
   Th, the Hero Medal!
$FrZM:
Frog: You hath done well to find this locale.[nl]
   Th, the Hero Badge!
$FrZO:
Frog: Aye...[nl]
   Then thou hast seen the lad.[nl]
   Yet there's nary a thing I canst do against Magus.
$FrZQ:
Frog: The legendary Masamune is required to fight Magus.
[pause]
   And I've no right to wield it.
$FrZS:
Frog: Please leave now...
$FrZU:
Frog: Nary a soul remains to mend'eth the Masamune.
$FrZW:
Lucca: A broken sword...[nl]
   It's part of the Masamune!
$FrZY:
Robos: A broken sword...[nl]
   A part of the Masamune!
$FrZa:
Lucca: It's engraved with archaic letters.[nl]
   I think I can read it.[nl]
   Um...mm...
$FrZc:
Lucca: ...M...e...l...c...h...i...o...r!
$FrZe:
Lucca: «Melchior?!»[nl]
   That guy in Medina Village?
$FrZg:
Robos: Something is written in archaic script.[nl]
   I will translate...
$FrZi:
Robos: .........[nl]
   R...o...i...h...c...l...e...m?
$FrZk:
Robos: Roihclem?
$FrZm:
Robos: System error![nl]
   I reversed it![nl]
   It says «Melchior!»
$FrZo:
Marle: Melchior?[nl]
   That guy in Medina Village?
[pause]
   What does this mean, Crono?
$FrZq:
Frog: 'Tis thee again.
$FrZs:
Frog: This sword...[nl]
   'Tis the Masamune?
$FrZu:
Frog: I must ponder this turn of events.[nl]
   Remain'eth here the night.
$FrZw:
GLENN: Aaah!
$FrZy:
CYRUS: Beware Glenn!!
$Fra0:
GLENN: Cyrus![nl]
   The sword...
[pause]
   The Masamune!
$Fra2:
OZZIE: Gyah ha ha...[nl]
   Is THAT the best you can do?!
[pause]
   Without your sword, you're nothing!
$Fra4:
CYRUS: Arrgh![nl]
   You haven't beaten me yet!
$Fra6:
GLENN: C, Cyrus...[nl]
   I'm a g...goner.
$Fra8:
CYRUS: Glenn, escape while I keep them at bay.
$FraA:
GLENN: B, but...!
$FraC:
CYRUS: If you stay, they'll get us both.[nl]
   Go on, Glenn!
$FraE:
Magus: You'd better worry more about yourself, Cyrus!
$FraG:
CYRUS: Come on, Glenn![nl]
   GO!!
$FraI:
CYRUS: Aaahhh...!
$FraK:
GLENN: C, Cyrus!
$FraM:
CYRUS: R...run...Glenn...

GLENN: C, Cyrus!?
[pause]
   Cyruuus!!
$FraQ:
Magus: Harumph![nl]
   What's the matter?[nl]
   Aren't you going to try your luck?
$FraS:
GLENN: Err...!
$FraU:
OZZIE: Gyah, ha ha...[nl]
   Cat got your tongue kid?
$FraW:
OZZIE: How about it, Magus?[nl]
   Can't you give him a more fitting form?
$FraY:
Magus: All right, why not?[nl]
   There's always time for a little fun.
$Fraa:
GLENN: !!
$Frac:
GLENN: A...augh!!
$Frae:
GLENN: Aaaaack!
$Frag:
OZZIE: Gyah ha ha...![nl]
   You spineless wimp!
$Frai:
Frog: 10 years hath passed...
[pause]
   Can I do it?[nl]
   I've changed so much.[nl]
   Alas, poor Cyrus...!
$Frak:
Frog: Awaketh, Crono.
$Fram:
Frog: Though we may fail...[nl]
   ...let us go to Magus's lair.
$Frao:
Frog: Thou knowest his power?
$Fraq:
Lucca: Nothing can beat science!
$Fras:
Marle: We won't be beaten by a bad guy!
$Frau:
Robos: We must do it to save our future!
$Fraw:
A strange monster came by the other day, mumbling about Queen Leene and the Masamune...
$Fray:
That shore were an ugly frog![nl]
Hardy har!
$Frb0:
Yeah, he sure was weird.[nl]
Ahem...
[pause]
Oh, I meant, such a magnificent frog![nl]
He'll be a hero or a chancellor...!
$Frb2:
MISTRESS: Little Tata must be away...[nl]
   We haven't seen him in awhile.
[pause]
   But things are a lot quieter without that brat around.
$Frb4:
MISTRESS: I guess Tata's home now.[nl]
   It was so quiet without him...
[pause]
   But I'm glad he's back.[nl]
   It was a bit TOO quiet around here...
$Frb6:
MISTRESS: And I have plans of my own...
[pause]
   Now that the boy's back, it's time to set my sights on his father, hee hee.
$Frb8:
I can't believe the legendary Hero is that naughty runt, Tata!
$FrbA:
So Tata was a fake after all!
[pause]
Then where's the real Hero?
$FrbC:
Tata's been working hard lately.[nl]
Maybe he's growing up.
$FrbE:
I can't believe the legendary Hero was a boy from this village!
$FrbG:
Did you hear the latest?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FrbI:
Everyone's talking about him![nl]
I bet his old man is proud!
$FrbK:
Well, remember that the legendary Hero is from this village then!
$FrbM:
And I thought the Hero was from here.[nl]
What a let down...
$FrbO:
Have you heard about the magical cave?[nl]
The one east of the Denadoro Mountains?
[pause]
I saw a rock wall there pop open, and a gaggle of ghouls just walked right in!
[pause]
Best to leave Magus and his cronies alone, though!
$FrbQ:
A slimy frog man beat Magus?
[pause]
If I knew it was gonna be so easy, I'd have done it myself![nl]
Geez!
$FrbS:
TOMA: Hey, you again![nl]
   How 'bout buying me a soda?[nl]
      Sure.[nl]
      No way.
$FrbU:
TOMA: Thanks![nl]
   I'll wish you a safe journey.
$FrbW:
TOMA: I tracked down the Rainbow Shell that the chief wanted.[nl]
   It's on some small island...
[pause]
   Only thing is...I don't know WHICH island.
[pause]
   And the money he gave me is gone.[nl]
   What should I do?
$FrbY:
TOMA: What a miser!
[pause]
   I don't even have enough for grub!
$Frba:
[nl]
                  It's locked!
$Frbc:
Hey![nl]
Is that a Naga-ette Bromide you've got there?!
$Frbe:
I'll trade you something good for it.[nl]
How about it?[nl]
      Let's trade![nl]
      I don't want the geezer's loot.
$Frbg:
Hmph![nl]
Fine then, suit yourself.
$Frbi:
Really, you mean it?
[pause]
Yahoo! Now just hold your horses and I'll be back in a jiffy!
$Frbk:
It's unlocked so you're free to take it.
[pause]
And I'll be taking this.[nl]
Hee hee...
$Frbm:
Don't tell Grannie.[nl]
Hee, hee, my very own Naga-ette pet.
$Frbo:
[nl]
            You got 1 [item]!
$Frbq:

          You found 1 [item]!

                     Empty!

$Frbu:
This is the Queen's Palace, the center of Zeal Kingdom.
[pause]
Which makes THIS, the center of the universe.
$Frbw:
No one may enter while the Queen is away at the Ocean Palace.
$Frby:
To open the door from outside, an item like Schala's pendant is needed to break the seal.
$Frc0:
Y...your pendant!![nl]
It looks just like Schala's!
[pause]
I heard that when Schala communes with the Mammon Machine, her pendant starts to glow.
$Frc2:
My, what strange clothes![nl]
You must be travelers from afar?
[pause]
Use the Spring of Recovery to recuperate from your journey.
$Frc4:
Visitors, do you like plants?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$Frc6:
I see...[nl]
You're like the Queen.
$Frc8:
Oh, you're just like me!
[pause]
But the Queen ordered me to burn this sapling I received from the Guru of Life.
[pause]
He said it was a magical sapling, with powers to cure the environment.
$FrcA:
What shall I do?[nl]
      Burn it.[nl]
      Secretly plant it.
$FrcC:
You're right...[nl]
I must obey the Queen's command.
$FrcE:
You're right! Even if it IS the Queen's command, the Guru of Life gave it to me.[nl]
I can't burn it...
[pause]
I'm going to grow it with love.[nl]
Someday it may save the environment.
$FrcG:
If I'm reborn, I hope it'll be in a land full of green forests.
$FrcI:
The Queen's two heirs, Schala and Janus, get along so well.
[pause]
If only Janus would open up to others...
$FrcK:
Did you know that Belthasar, the Guru of Reason, has secret rooms in Enhasa and Kajar?
$FrcM:
The Queen's aide, Dalton, was in charge of the Ocean Palace, until some traveling prophet took over.
[pause]
He's in a bad mood so you should avoid him.
$FrcO:
That man's a newcomer but his accurate prophecies earned the Queen's trust.
[pause]
He's a drifter...[nl]
He's not one of us Enlightened Ones, nor of the Earthbound Ones either.[nl]
Hmmm...
$FrcQ:
The completion of the Ocean Palace will allow Zeal to last forever!
[pause]
And there will be no fear or sadness, just eternal peace.
$FrcS:
The source of our energy lies deep below the sea.
[pause]
Now that its exact location has been found, the Ocean Palace will be built.
$FrcU:
Use the Queen's hall to get to the Ocean Palace, which is under construction.
$FrcW:
The Queen must have borne pain and sorrow in silence.
[pause]
No pain, no gain...[nl]
Zeal, too, was born out of much sacrifice and work.
$FrcY:
The wandering prophet is amazing![nl]
All his prophecies have come true.
[pause]
It's as if he knows the future![nl]
How eerie...
$Frca:
They say that Gaspar, the Guru of Time, continues his work on some deserted island.
[pause]
He's making a «Chrono Trigger» or[nl]
«Time Egg,» or something.[nl]
But no one has seen him for ages.
$Frcc:
Even Belthasar is gone, after designing the Blackbird and the Ocean Palace.
[pause]
How strange that the 3 Gurus who guide Zeal have all disappeared.
$Frce:
Beings that are born of dreams, must return to them...
[pause]
The power of Lavos can make hopes and dreams come true...
$Frcg:
Ask the Queen or the Gurus if you want to know about the Mammon Machine and the Ocean Palace.
[pause]
But just between us, she probably won't give you the time of day.
$Frci:
The Earth is alive, and it has changed over the aeons.[nl]
From flat lands into mountains...[nl]
From mountains into oceans...
[pause]
You may find THE WAY...[nl]
That is, if you could pass aeons of time at the forbidden palace, or the Sun Keep.
$Frck:
I wanna be the wind, Masa!
$Frcm:
Oh, you will some day.
$Frco:
Big sister Doreen's at Enhasa again
$Frcq:
Yeah...[nl]
That's 'cause she likes dreams.
$Frcs:
I like the wind better![nl]
Whoosh!
$Frcu:
I wonder how ol' man Melchior is...[nl]
Humans are so odd...
$Frcw:
Could you...[nl]
Scratch my back?[nl]
      Sure![nl]
      No way!
$Frcy:
......
[pause]
How cruel!
$Frd0:
Umm![nl]
Thanks!
$Frd2:
Uhh...[nl]
You got it...
[pause]
Phew...
$Frd4:
Phew...[nl]
Thank you!
$Frd6:
You discovered the Nu's scratch-point!
$Frd8:
That pendant of yours...
[pause]
It looks like Schala's, but it doesn't glow.
$FrdA:
Schala's pendant was made from the same red rock as the Mammon Machine.
[pause]
When she chants, the pendant glows.
$FrdC:
Beyond is the hall of the Mammon Machine. The incredible energy of Lavos pervades it!
$FrdE:
The hall of the Mammon Machine is beyond.[nl]
But the power is gone...
$FrdG:
The Mammon Machine?[nl]
You came to see it?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$FrdI:
I thought so![nl]
Feel the flow of the mighty Lavos's power?[nl]
Oh...I feel faint.
$FrdK:
Just as I thought![nl]
Unfortunately, the Mammon Machine has been moved.
$FrdM:
Oh, but you MUST feel them![nl]
The last of the great Lavos's emanations!
$FrdO:
Tragic...I can no longer feel the last waves of energy.
$FrdQ:
The prophet's aura is full of hatred and sorrow.
[pause]
He'll destroy himself, and those he loves.
$FrdS:
This leads to the hall of the Mammon Machine.
$FrdU:
This connects to the Queen's hall.
$FrdW:
This will take you to the bedroom.
$FrdY:
THIS is the source of Zeal's strength.[nl]
The Mammon Machine...it draws and magnifies the infinite power of Lavos.
$Frda:
That pendant...[nl]
It looks like Schala's.
[pause]
When she chants to the Mammon Machine, the pendant glows...
[pause]
As if they were in union.
$Frdc:
The 3 Gurus made the Mammon Machine from the royal family's red rock.
[pause]
Melchior, who has studied much about Lavos, was in charge of the plans.[nl]
But then he disappeared...
$Frde:
Magic strong enough to control the extraction of energy, is needed to control the Mammon Machine.
$Frdg:
When the Mammon Machine was finished, the Queen changed almost over night.
[pause]
Just between us, I heard that ANYONE who opposes her, and not just the Earthbound Ones, vanishes.
$Frdi:
Melchior, who opposed the Queen's plans, has vanished.[nl]
You're not thinking what I am, are you?
$Frdk:
If the Mammon Machine is moved to the Ocean Palace, we can extract even more energy from Lavos.
[pause]
The ultimate dream of eternal youth and life, is now possible!
[pause]
Oh, almighty Queen, our kingdom of Zeal will reign forever!
$Frdm:
That glow...?!
[pause]
That's the pendant the Gurus made for Schala!![nl]
How did you get it?
$Frdo:
That glow...!?[nl]
Is that Schala's pendant?
$Frdq:
Marle: Hmm...[nl]
   Just as we thought, it won't budge.
$Frds:
Ayla: Strange.[nl]
   How come?
$Frdu:
Robos: This door has a strong defense mechanism.
$Frdw:
Lucca: Hmm...[nl]
   There's something to this pendant.
$Frdy:
Frog: 'Tis a mere DOOR that keeps us bound, hand, foot...and tongue!
$Fre0:
Marle: Yea, we did it!
$Fre2:
Lucca: Heh, heh...[nl]
   Even a door of this caliber can't keep science at bay!
$Fre4:
Robos: There is no doubt.[nl]
   Marle's pendant is made of the «Guru's Rock.»
$Fre6:
Frog: What doth challenge us now?
$Fre8:
Ayla: Ayla go![nl]
   No fear, [crononick]!
$FreA:
Schala!!
$FreC:
Oh, you're back Janus![nl]
Is something wrong?
$FreE:
JANUS: The black wind...
$FreG:
SCHALA: You feel it too?[nl]
   Don't worry, it'll be alright.
$FreI:
SCHALA: Now, hold onto this.
$FreK:
JANUS: What is it?
$FreM:
SCHALA: It's a kind of amulet.[nl]
   If something should happen, it'll protect you.
[pause]
   I wish I could be with you always...[nl]
   But mother has other plans.
$FreO:
JANUS: She's NOT our mother![nl]
   She looks like mother, but inside she has changed.
$FreQ:
SCHALA: ......
[pause]
   Still I can't...[nl]
   Janus, I'm sorry.
$FreS:
Excuse me, Highness.
$FreU:
The Queen asks for your immediate presence at the Ocean Palace.
$FreW:
SCHALA: All right.
$FreY:
SCHALA: Well, Janus...[nl]
   I'll be going.
$Frea:
SCHALA: Oh![nl]
   Who might you be?
$Frec:
Miss Schala, please hurry.[nl]
If you're late, I'll be punished!
$Free:
SCHALA: Oh yes, I'm sorry.
$Freg:
JANUS: ......[nl]
   Go away.
$Frei:
JANUS: Don't waste your time.[nl]
   Alfador only likes me.
$Frek:
PROPHET: !?
$Frem:
DALTON: Oh![nl]
   So it's you!
$Freo:
QUEEN: Who are you!?[nl]
   How did you get in here?
$Freq:
PROPHET: Your majesty...[nl]
   They are the evildoers I warned you of.
$Fres:
QUEEN: How DARE you think you could oppose me, you...foreigners![nl]
   You're worse than the Gurus!
$Freu:
QUEEN: Fools![nl]
   Dalton, take them away!
$Frew:
Dalton: Yes ma'am![nl]
   By your leave...
$Frey:
DALTON: Golem!
$Frf0:
DALTON: My poor Golem![nl]
   That was inexcusable!
$Frf2:
QUEEN: Mwa, ha, ha...[nl]
   Fear not![nl]
   You won't die...immediately, that is!
[pause]
   But by the time we're through with you, you'll be begging us to end your suffering.
[pause]
   What a delicious diversion!
$Frf4:
JANUS: Hmph![nl]
   Idiots...[nl]
   What will you do, Schala?
$Frf6:
SCHALA: Let us rescue them.
$Frf8:
JANUS: I think it's useless.[nl]
   Besides, if they escape, you'll be in trouble.
$FrfA:
SCHALA: Don't worry about me.
[pause]
   They just might be able to rescue the Gurus.
$FrfC:
JANUS: Schala...
$FrfE:
SCHALA: Are you all right?[nl]
   Quickly, escape from the palace!
[pause]
   And if you can, please rescue Melchior!
$FrfG:
SCHALA: He was sent to the Mountain of Woe for opposing the Queen.
[pause]
   Please![nl]
   You have to help him!
$FrfI:
I'm afraid I can't allow that...
$FrfK:
PROPHET: Your meddling tires me.[nl]
   You'll...just have to disappear!
$FrfM:
SCHALA: You mustn't!
$FrfO:
PROPHET: ......!
$FrfQ:
JANUS: Stop!
$FrfS:
PROPHET: Okay...I'll spare them.
[pause]
   But in return, you WILL cooperate, Schala!
$FrfU:
PROPHET: Now, show me how you came here.
$FrfW:
The Mammon Machine was moved to the Ocean Palace to obtain the raw energy of Lavos.
$FrfY:
The Ocean Palace is complete.[nl]
Zeal will rule forever!!
$Frfa:
Our kingdom is shrouded in eternal light.
[pause]
There is no sadness or fear, only eternal peace.
$Frfc:
The Queen took Schala with her to the Ocean Palace.
[pause]
We Enlightened Ones will finally attain immortality.
$Frfe:
The way to the Ocean Palace is through the Queen's hall.
[pause]
A day will come when all may see the shining new Mammon Machine.
$Frfg:
DALTON: Phooey![nl]
   Why is the Prophet allowed inside while I'm stuck with guard duty?
$Frfi:
DALTON: Ha![nl]
   There you are...

   No matter what the price!

What do you think you can do?

   This power can only end in ruin!

   It has a lot of sentimental value!

      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$GhLI:
Marle: It's a family heirloom.[nl]
   May I please have it back?
$GhLK:
   I came to see the Festival![nl]
   You...live in this town, don't you?![nl]
   I feel a little out of place here.

This is the renowned[nl]
«Tent of Horrors!»[nl]
Spend your [num8] Silver Points here![nl]
Parental discretion advised.
$GhLc:
No time to talk.[nl]
I'm just sitting down for my lunch.
$GhLe:
Those runners are busy racing, so they won't talk to you.
$GhLg:
This Kingdom's been through a lot, like the war against Magus, 400 years ago.
[pause]
Thank goodness things are so peaceful now.
$GhLi:
I heard this guy pays big bucks for charms, weapons, pendants, and other rarities.
$GhLk:
Keep going if you want to demo Lucca's robot battle trainer![nl]
Collect Silver Points if you win!
$GhLm:
This is Leene Square. They say people who hear Leene's Bell ring will have interesting and happy lives!
$GhLo:
What's the big deal?[nl]
So what if we won a war against a Wizard hundreds of years ago!
$GhLq:
They're still setting up.[nl]
Why don't you come back in a while?
$GhLs:
I heard Lucca and her dad have made another crazy invention.
[pause]
Hope it doesn't blow up like all the others!
$GhLu:
They ought to be ready now.[nl]
Make for the far side of the Square.
[pause]
Marle: This is going to be fun![nl]
   Come on, Crono!
$GhLw:
Lucca's device is all set up.[nl]
She's at the north end of the Square.
$GhLy:
Marle: Hold your horses![nl]
   I want to get some candy.

Marle: Crono...[nl]
   I'm having a great time!

The merchants went back to their warehouse to stock up on more goods.
$GhMI:
You have [num8] Silver Points.
[pause]
Want to exchange 10 Silver Points[nl]
for 50 G?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$GhMK:
Not enough Silver Points.
$GhMM:
Come again.
$GhMO:
I hate fairs![nl]
Say, do you know the latest gossip?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$GhMQ:
Then scram!
$GhMS:
Just between us, I heard that the King is distressed over his tomboy of a daughter!
[pause]
Just once, I would like to see how wild she really is!
$GhMU:
TABAN: Step right on up, any of you who have the time and the courage![nl]
   Our «Super Dimension Warp» is the invention of the century!
$GhMW:
TABAN: To use it, jump up here...
$GhMY:
TABAN: ...and you'll get teleported here![nl]
   It's the masterwork of my beautiful daughter, Lucca.
$GhMa:
TABAN: Give it a try, kid?[nl]
   ...Oh, it's you, Crono!
$GhMc:
TABAN: Don't worry, we tried it on our pets![nl]
   There's no reason why it shouldn't work as well on humans!
[pause]
   So, step right up!
$GhMe:
TABAN: It...WORKED?![nl]
   I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
[pause]
   Uh, er, a thrilling display of science at its best, ladies and gentlemen!
$GhMg:
Lucca: Crono!
$GhMi:
Lucca: Where have you been!?[nl]
   No one wants to try the Telepod!
[pause]
   How about you?
$GhMk:
Lucca: Just hop onto the left pod!
$GhMm:
Lucca: So, how was it?[nl]
   Want to try it again?
$GhMo:
Marle: It looks like fun![nl]
   I'll watch while you try it out!
$GhMq:
Marle: What a kick![nl]
   I want to try it, too!
$GhMs:
Lucca: Huh?
$GhMu:
Lucca: Hey Crono, how did you pick up a cutie like her?
$GhMw:
Marle: Hang on, Crono![nl]
   I'll be right there!
$GhMy:
TABAN: Behold, ladies and gentlemen, as this vision of loveliness steps aboard the machine!
$GhN0:
Marle: Don't go away.[nl]
   I'll be right back!
$GhN2:
TABAN: You're sure about this...?[nl]
   There's still time to change your mind!
$GhN4:
Marle: No way![nl]
   Throw the switch!
$GhN6:
TABAN: Okay, everyone, let's give her a great big hand when she reappears!
$GhN8:
TABAN: All systems on!
$GhNA:
Lucca: Begin energy transfer!
$GhNC:
Marle: What's happening?[nl]
   My pendant...it's...
$GhNE:
Lucca: She's so familiar![nl]
   I KNOW I've seen her somewhere...
$GhNG:
Lucca: Huh?
$GhNI:
ALL: Oh wow.[nl]
   That was GREAT!
$GhNK:
TABAN: Hmm?
$GhNM:
TABAN: Lucca![nl]
   Where is she?!
$GhNO:
Lucca: ......
$GhNQ:
TABAN: Show's over, folks![nl]
   Let's head along now!
$GhNS:
TABAN: What's going on Lucca?[nl]
   WHERE IS SHE?
$GhNU:
Lucca: The way she disappeared...[nl]
   It couldn't have been the Telepod!
[pause]
   The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant...
$GhNW:
TABAN: What are we going to do now?
$GhNY:
Lucca: Crono![nl]
   You brought her here, YOU get her back!
$GhNa:
Lucca: Crono!
$GhNc:
TABAN: You're actually going to do it?![nl]
   What a fine lad!
$GhNe:
Lucca: Listen![nl]
   I don't know where this machine is going to send you, but we haven't any other choice.
[pause]
TABAN: Won't they both be lost?
[pause]
Lucca: This is our only hope![nl]
   That pendant seems to be the key, so hang on to it Crono, and brace yourself!
$GhNg:
Lucca: Power to full!
$GhNi:
TABAN: Roger!
$GhNk:
Lucca: More![nl]
   Give me more power!
$GhNm:
Lucca: There![nl]
   We did it!
$GhNo:
Lucca: I'll follow you after I know what went wrong.[nl]
   Good luck, Crono!
$GhNq:
Marle: Phew![nl]
   We're back!
$GhNs:
Marle: Crono, Lucca, why don't you come home with me to the castle?[nl]
   I'd like you to come over for dinner!
$GhNu:
Lucca: Sorry for putting you through all that, Marle.
$GhNw:
Marle: Are you joking?[nl]
   That's the most fun I've had in months![nl]
   And I have some new friends, too!
$GhNy:
Lucca: Crono, be a gentleman and take her home.
[pause]
   I've got some work to do.
$GhO0:
Marle: See you soon, Lucca!
$GhO2:
Marle: Will you escort me home, Crono?
$GhO4:
Check out that girl's glasses!
$GhO6:
She could probably see the back side of the moon with those.
$GhO8:
Wow!
$GhOA:
Lucca's inventions never work right.
$GhOC:
I guess even HER inventions have to work, sometimes.
$GhOE:
I'm the lawyer, Pierre.
$GhOG:
I'm the Chancellor, the prosecutor!
$GhOI:
CHANCELLOR: Members of the court.
[pause]
   We now bring forth the defendant, Crono, who is charged with abducting Princess Nadia.
$GhOK:
CHANCELLOR: What shall we do with him?[nl]
   Fire, perhaps?
[pause]
   Hang him upside down for a few years?
[pause]
   Or...shall we employ the guillotine?
$GhOM:
CHANCELLOR: You, the jury, shall decide his fate.[nl]
   Now, let us begin.
$GhOO:
JUDGE: Crono, you are hereby ordered to tell the truth!
$GhOQ:
PIERRE: Crono is charged with «Premeditated Abduction of Royalty.»[nl]
   The question is, did he kidnap Princess Nadia? The answer?
[pause]
   No, he did not.[nl]
   In fact, no «abduction» took place!
$GhOS:
PIERRE: The two met completely by accident. In fact, the Princess ASKED Crono if SHE could join HIM!
$GhOU:
CHANCELLOR: Is this true? Who actually[nl]
   started this whole mess?[nl]
      I did.[nl]
      Marle did.
$GhOW:
CHANCELLOR: Just as I suspected![nl]
   The defendant deliberately tried to get near the Princess!
$GhOY:
CHANCELLOR: Are you sure?[nl]
   We have witnesses who'll say YOU were the one that bumped into the princess.
$GhOa:
CHANCELLOR: The Princess then innocently followed you to Lucca's little sideshow.
[pause]
   Whereupon you both disappeared![nl]
   If that wasn't criminal abduction, I don't know WHAT is!
$GhOc:
CHANCELLOR: And I have facts that throw the defendant's character into question!
$GhOe:
PIERRE: Objection!
[pause]
   This can't have any relevance whatsoever to this case!
$GhOg:
JUDGE: Care to respond, Chancellor?
$GhOi:
CHANCELLOR: Crono's character is at the very core of this case!
[pause]
PIERRE: We have nothing to hide.
$GhOk:
PIERRE: We have a witness.[nl]
   A little girl who will vouch for the character of the defendant.
$GhOm:
This nice man...[nl]
He brought me my kitty.
$GhOo:
Thank you for being so kind!
$GhOq:
PIERRE: How about that?[nl]
   Doesn't this young man deserve a medal?
$GhOs:
PIERRE: Whew...[nl]
   Looks like they're buying it.
$GhOu:
CHANCELLOR: The defendant's cruelty is quite evident.
$GhOw:
CHANCELLOR: You remember HER, don't you?[nl]
   The poor little girl who lost her cat?[nl]
   You wouldn't even listen to her!
$GhOy:
You ignored me!
$GhP0:
CHANCELLOR: Oh you poor dear![nl]
   Thank you.
$GhP2:
CHANCELLOR: As you can see, no further proof is necessary here.
$GhP4:
CHANCELLOR: Have you ever stolen[nl]
   anything?[nl]
      Well...yes.[nl]
      No! I've never been a thief.
$GhP6:
CHANCELLOR: See![nl]
   He lacks morals![nl]
   This should be on the record![nl]
   He's crying out for help!
$GhP8:
CHANCELLOR: DO NOT feign ignorance![nl]
   We have a witness.
$GhPA:
Him![nl]
He ate my lunch right off the table!
$GhPC:
CHANCELLOR: Let the record show that he stole from a poor, helpless man!
$GhPE:
PIERRE: The issue here is MOTIVE.[nl]
   Was there any motive for this fine citizen to kidnap Princess Nadia?[nl]
   No! There was none.
$GhPG:
CHANCELLOR: What about ransom?
[pause]
   Crono, her fortune DID tempt[nl]
   you, did it not?[nl]
      No.[nl]
      Yes.
$GhPI:
CHANCELLOR: So, you admit it!
$GhPK:
CHANCELLOR: Nothing more your honor.[nl]
   The prosecution rests.
$GhPM:
CHANCELLOR: Are you sure?[nl]
   You really weren't tempted?[nl]
      Not at all.[nl]
      Just a bit.
$GhPO:
CHANCELLOR: That's enough.[nl]
   I have no more questions.
[pause]
PIERRE: It is evident that my client is a fine, noble young man![nl]
   Your honor, the defense rests.
$GhPQ:
CHANCELLOR: Please keep in mind that he just said he had NO interest in her fortune.
[pause]
   Witness please!
$GhPS:
He can't fool me, I saw him with my own eyes!
$GhPU:
Dear me![nl]
I'm so nervous!
$GhPW:
That man grabbed the pendant even before he checked to see if the Princess was okay!
$GhPY:
He didn't seem to want to return it, either.
$GhPa:
He tried to sell it to the merchant, Melchior.
$GhPc:
CHANCELLOR: And this person's final bit of testimony will prove our case!
$GhPe:
I heard it clearly.[nl]
I heard her cry out with my own ears!
$GhPg:
Is that it?[nl]
Can I go?!
$GhPi:
JUDGE: Members of the jury...[nl]
   If he is guilty, stand to the left.[nl]
   If innocent, stand to the right.
$GhPk:
Guilty.
$GhPm:
Not guilty.
$GhPo:
Order in the court!
$GhPq:
A verdict has been reached!
$GhPs:
We have a majority!
$GhPu:
The verdict is...guilty![nl]
The sentence? Solitary confinement, pending execution in 3 days!
$GhPw:
[nl]
The verdict is...not guilty!
[pause]
But the fact remains that even if he did not kidnap her, he ran off with her.[nl]
3 days solitary confinement as punishment.
$GhPy:
CHANCELLOR: Take him away!

Lucca: So Lavos arrived in this period.
$GhTm:
Robos: So Lavos was «born» here...
$GhTo:
Marle: So![nl]
   Lavos descended in this era!
$GhTq:
Frog: Through no fault of Magus does Lavos live![nl]
   Lavos hath fallen from the sky in ancient times.
$GhTs:
Ayla: Lavos huge![nl]
   [crononick] fight it?
$GhTu:
Ayla: [crononick]![nl]
   We go where Lavos fall!
$GhTw:
Lucca: We may be able to do something now![nl]
   Let's go find out!
$GhTy:
Robos: Lavos should be weaker now.[nl]
   Perhaps we can put an end to him?!
$GhU0:
Marle: It just arrived so there may be something we can do![nl]
   Let's go see!
$GhU2:
Frog: Left unscathed, it will burrow deep within the earth.[nl]
   Best to defeat it now!
$GhU4:
Marle: Th, there's a Gate!
$GhU6:
Lucca: Why is there a Gate here?!
$GhU8:
Robos: A Gate has formed!
$GhUA:
Frog: 'Tis a Gate?
$GhUC:
Ayla: Lavos very fast![nl]
   Deep under earth already.
$GhUE:
Marle: This Gate was made by Lavos.[nl]
   Maybe Lavos is the source of all Gates?
$GhUG:
Lucca: Now I understand![nl]
   The immense energy that Lavos gives off alters time and creates Gates.
$GhUI:
Robos: It appears that the immense energy that Lavos radiates alters time and creates Gates.
$GhUK:
Frog: M, mayhap Lavos be the cause of this warp?
[pause]
   The one in Magus's Castle was immense.
$GhUM:
Ayla: What wrong, [crononick]?[nl]
   Fight Lavos![nl]
   Go in here.[nl]
   Yes?
$GhUO:
Marle: Boy, this is exciting!
$GhUQ:
Lucca: Well it IS the Gate nearest to Lavos.[nl]
   We have no idea as to where it leads.
$GhUS:
Robos: The Time Gyro says...[nl]
   What!?[nl]
   12,000 years in the past?![nl]
   That was some trip!
$GhUU:
Frog: Wh, where art we?[nl]
   'Tis strange...!
$GhUW:
Ayla: Where this, [crononick]?!
$GhUY:
[nl]
          The power is sealed...
$GhUa:
PROPHET: Hmm...so you came in through here.
$GhUc:
PROPHET: Now Schala![nl]
   After I throw them in, I want you to seal the portal shut.

SCHALA: N, no![nl]
   You can't make me!

PROPHET: Obey me![nl]
   Their lives are at stake!
$GhUi:
SCHALA: I...oh, all right...
$GhUk:
SCHALA: Please forgive me...
$GhUm:
Marle: Why did the Prophet let us go?
$GhUo:
Lucca: The Prophet could have just done away with us.
$GhUq:
Robos: Why would the Prophet spare us?
$GhUs:
Frog: 'Tis true, he hath spared us.[nl]
   But something is amiss.
$GhUu:
Lucca: The key to defeating Lavos must exist in that period.
$GhUw:
Robos: The key to defeating Lavos must exist in that era.
$GhUy:
Frog: Where hast Magus gone?[nl]
   I shan't allow him to get away.
$GhV0:
Ayla: They take energy from Lavos.[nl]
   Lavos not get weak?
$GhV2:
Marle: But we can't get back to that time.[nl]
   What can we do?
$GhV4:
Lucca: But the Gate to that time has been sealed.[nl]
   Is there another way back?
$GhV6:
Robos: But the Gate has been shut.
$GhV8:
Frog: Yet Schala hast sealed the Gate.[nl]
   'Tis not possible to returneth.
$GhVA:
Ayla: Door gone.[nl]
   No can return.
$GhVC:
Marle: Wait a minute. I've seen the design on the doors this pendant opens, somewhere else...
$GhVE:
Lucca: The crest on those sealed doors...[nl]
   We've seen it elsewhere, haven't we?!
$GhVG:
Robos: Wait. The crest on the doors that the pendant opens...[nl]
   I have seen them in my own time!
$GhVI:
Frog: Thou hast seen elsewhere the crest on the doors that the pendant opens, correct?
$GhVK:
Marle: Let's check it out, Crono!
$GhVM:
Lucca: We may yet find our way back to that era![nl]
   Let's get cracking, Crono!
$GhVO:
Robos: Let us return to my time!
$GhVQ:
Frog: 'Tis time to depart, eh, Crono?!
$GhVS:
So, this is the summit of Death Peak!
$GhVU:
Marle: All who fear the night and stand against the darkness...[nl]
   Please give us strength!
$GhVW:
Lucca: You who fear the night and fight the coming of darkness...[nl]
   Give us strength!
$GhVY:
Robos: You who fight the onslaught of night and darkness...[nl]
   Please lend us your power.
$GhVa:
Frog: We ask for your strength...[nl]
   Thee who fear'eth the night and stand 'gainst the darkness.
$GhVc:

$GhVo:
Marle: But...[nl]
   We've come so far!
$GhVq:
Marle: Please answer me![nl]
   Don't leave me!!!
$GhVs:
[nl]
                 Crono--!!
$GhVu:
Lucca: It can't be![nl]
   What use was it to come so far?
$GhVw:
Lucca: Crono![nl]
   Say something![nl]
   Don't ignore us!
$GhVy:
Frog: 'Tis folly...[nl]
   To hath travelled so far.
$GhW0:
Frog: Crono![nl]
   Giveth an answer!
$GhW2:
Robos: That can't be it![nl]
   We've worked so hard.
$GhW4:
Robos: Crono![nl]
   Please answer us!
$GhW6:
Lucca: Don't be sad.[nl]
   It was silly to think we could get him back...
$GhW8:
Robos: Do not dispair.[nl]
   We placed too much hope in bringing Crono back.
$GhWA:
Frog: Despair not...[nl]
   Fate be not malleable.
$GhWC:
Ayla: No sadness![nl]
   Ayla lonely too![nl]
   Sad [crononick] not come back.

   Are you even listening?![nl]
   There's so much you have to know.
$GhWk:

$HOfQ:
Robos: I have come to think that someone, or something wanted us to see all this.
[pause]

   It is almost as if some entity wanted to relive its past.
$HOfS:
Ayla: Ayla know![nl]

$HOfU:
Frog: 'Tis true that mortals do relive their most profound memories before death claimeth them.
[pause]
   Yet those memories most often are sad ones.
$HOfW:
Robos: Thinking things like, «If only I had done this,» or, «I shouldn't have done that...» triggers unpleasant, old memories.
$HOfY:
Marle: Will that happen when our time comes?
[pause]
Lucca: Probably...who knows?
[pause]
Marle: Is there a point in time you'd want to return to, Lucca?
$HOfa:
Lucca: No...not really...
[pause]
Marle: I'm sorry, was that something I shouldn't have asked?
$HOfc:
Lucca: It's ok, it's just something I don't like to think about too much.
$HOfe:
Frog: Lavos playeth an integral role in the fortunes of this Entity...
$HOfg:
Magus: ...so who is this Entity?
$HOfi:
Robos: It is unknown, whose memories these are. It may be something beyond our comprehension.
[pause]
   Our journey may come to an end when we finally discover the identity of the Entity.[nl]
   ...[delay 07]    ...shall we turn in for the night?
$HOfk:
Robos: I'll give you my legs![nl]
   They're lightweight and well balanced.

$HOfo:
Lucca: Thanks, you're such a good friend.

Robos: A...friend?[nl]

   You called me your friend?

Robos: Lucca, you've got a kind heart.[nl]
   You're always thinking of others.
$HOfu:
Robos: This is for you.[nl]
   It's a piece of amber I created using the sap from a tree in my forest.

   It took 400 years and a lot of pressure to make![nl]
   I hope you'll find it useful.

$HPxw:
Welcome to Enhasa, in the magical kingdom of Zeal.
[pause]
We find truth in the bliss of sleep.
[pause]
Dear me![nl]
And who might you be?
$HPxy:
This is the eternal kingdom of Zeal, where dreams can come true.
[pause]
But at what price?
$HPy0:
Am I a butterfly dreaming I'm a man...
[pause]
Or a bowling ball dreaming I'm a plate of sashimi?[nl]
Never assume that what you see and feel is real!
$HPy2:
I'm Doreen.[nl]
Seek the hidden path, and open the doors of knowledge, each in turn.
$HPy4:
Welcome, what can I do for you?
$HPy6:
The Queen has sealed the Elemental Weapons in the north palace.
[pause]
You can see its entrance on the northern continent, but no one is allowed there.
$HPy8:
The door to the north palace is sealed with a mysterious energy.[nl]
Even we, the Enlightened Ones, cannot open it.
$HPyA:
What strange visitors![nl]
Welcome to Zeal![nl]
Is this part of a dream?
[pause]
Queen Zeal rules our magical kingdom.[nl]
She is without peer in beauty and greatness.
$HPyC:
The Queen has given us everything!
[pause]
After the King died, she nurtured magic, which has advanced the kingdom.[nl]
Zzzz...
$HPyE:
The Queen's palace is at the center of Zeal.[nl]
From there she protects the entire world.
[pause]
That's why we can sleep our days away.[nl]
Yawn...
$HPyG:
I wonder what's inside the north palace...
[pause]
I bet there's a key to it in the palace.[nl]
But entry is strictly forbidden.
$HPyI:
Do you believe in Fate?[nl]
Which means our lives are all predetermined?
$HPyK:
Well?[nl]
      Yes, of course.[nl]
      No such thing as Fate.[nl]
      I don't have time for this!
$HPyM:
So![nl]
You're a believer!
[pause]
Yes, it is useless for us to fight destiny!
$HPyO:
You're right![nl]
We're the masters of our own destinies!
[pause]
Speaking of which...[nl]
I believe there may be a doorway of destiny somewhere around here!
$HPyQ:
......
$HPyS:
The city of Kajar, where they study magic, lies on the edge of the western continent.
[pause]
The airship, «Blackbird,» is kept there.[nl]
Zzz...
$HPyU:
Zzz...zzz...[nl]
Truths exist in dreams...[nl]

   What a weird kid...
$HPyc:
Lucca: Hey, what's wrong?[nl]
   You have something to say?
$HPye:
Robos: How may I help you?
$HPyg:
Frog: 'Tis a sullen lad...
$HPyi:
Ayla: What wrong?[nl]
   That animal good food?
$HPyk:
BOY: The black wind howls...
$HPym:
BOY: One among you...[nl]
   ...will shortly perish.
$HPyo:
Marle: What?![nl]
   And out of the blue, like that?
$HPyq:
Lucca: H, hey![nl]
   Explain yourself!
$HPys:
Robos: Is, is it true?[nl]
   What are the percentages?
$HPyu:
Frog: Urchin![nl]
   Halt!
$HPyw:
Ayla: ???
$HPyy:
Marle: Crono...[nl]
   This is kinda creepy.
$HPz0:
Lucca: It's only a bad joke![nl]
   It's unscientific.
$HPz2:
Robos: Why did he say such a thing?
$HPz4:
Frog: I knoweth not what this portends.[nl]
   What an unpleasant lad.
$HPz6:
Ayla: Strange one...[nl]
   But not bad boy.
$HPz8:
The Guru of Reason, is gone.[nl]
Challenge me?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$HPzA:
Ok, here we go.
$HPzC:
Oh, okay...
$HPzE:
You're strong![nl]
Take this.
$HPzG:

$HPzI:

           You got a Magic Tab!

           You got a Speed Tab!
[pause]
   Nu......
$HPzK:
«The Mystery of Life»[nl]
Vol. 841, Ch. 26
[pause]
All life begins with Nu and ends with Nu...
[pause]
This is the truth![nl]
This is my belief![nl]
...at least for now.
$HPzM:
......
[pause]
......
$HPzO:
I've got Lode Shields, but I cannot sell them unless the Queen says it's okay.
$HPzQ:
......
[pause]
Is that Schala's Pendant?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$HPzS:
......
[pause]
I hate liars.
$HPzU:
......
[pause]
Welcome.
$HPzW:
Come again.
$HPzY:
The Ocean Palace lies deep beneath the waves.[nl]
It's a symbol of the Queen's power!
[pause]
The Palace is the source of light which sustains all living things.[nl]
Queen Zeal, the great!
$HPza:
The construction of the Ocean Palace is behind schedule.
[pause]
Eternal Palace, beneath the waves...[nl]
It'll be a sight to see when it's done!
$HPzc:
The Earthbound Ones are being allowed to work on the construction of the Palace.
[pause]
So they do have a purpose after all.
$HPze:
The Palace is finished![nl]
This heralds the dawn of the eternal kingdom of Zeal!!
$HPzg:
This is the magical city of Kajar.
[pause]
We do experiments for the Queen.
$HPzi:
My, you've got an unusual aura![nl]
So, you must possess the skill, too!
[pause]
It must be very primitive compared to ours![nl]
You poor things!
$HPzk:
Those lacking magic have always lived beneath the clouds, as the «Earthbound Ones.»
[pause]
After all, they lack what we have...
$HPzm:
How did we come by our skills?
[pause]
And why do others lack them?[nl]
Who cares!
$HPzo:
We've been seeing a lot of Janus lately.[nl]
He appears upset and paces around.
$HPzq:
His only friend, other than his sister, is that stupid cat.
[pause]
What tempest rages in his head?
$HPzs:
The Gurus of Life, Time, and Reason, live in Zeal.[nl]
Their skill and knowledge is supreme.
$HPzu:
Zeal's advances stem from a new energy source. Its power surpasses that of the elements.
$HPzw:
Your power differs from ours...
[pause]
In you I sense a strange aura of...kindness...
$HPzy:
I'm working on a tab that will boost magical skill.
[pause]
But my precious products have been disappearing lately...
[pause]
Must be the naughty Nu that hid them.[nl]
They love pranks...[nl]
What can I do?
$HQ00:
Oops, that's a defective item.
[pause]
Too bad, huh?[nl]
Ha ha ha.
$HQ02:
I heard a strange prophet has come to the palace.
[pause]
I don't know the details...but I heard he has uncanny powers.
$HQ04:
Indeed![nl]
That great aeroplane «Blackbird,»[nl]
which Belthasar built.
[pause]
When it soars in the sky, it looks alive![nl]
Belthasar is truly a genius!
$HQ06:
Queen Zeal has two heirs, Schala and Janus.
[pause]
Schala's an incredible child who has extraordinary magical powers.
[pause]
Being so gifted, she'll breeze through life.
$HQ08:
I heard Schala's powers far exceed those of her mother.
[pause]
Then there's her step-brother, Janus.[nl]
He's of royal blood, but he doesn't seem to have a speck of magic.
$HQ0A:
That's the Sun Keep you see on the southern continent. A Sun Stone, once the source of this world's power, was kept there.
[pause]
But when we began using our new energy source, it was sealed up just like the north palace.
[pause]
They claim we don't need the energy of this tired, old planet.
$HQ0C:
A Guru once told me that the Sun Stone could store the almost infinite energy of our sun.
[pause]
But if its energy were used up, it would lose its glow and change into a Moon Stone.
$HQ0E:
Did you know a Moon Stone can be recharged if you leave it in the sun?
[pause]
But it takes aeons, so it's unlikely for us to see that gorgeous glow again.
$HQ0G:
Scratch, scratch...
$HQ0I:
Oooh...
$HQ0K:
Phew...!
$HQ0M:
Tee hee...!
$HQ0O:
......
$HQ0Q:
Water summons wind...[nl]
...wind makes fire dance.
$HQ0S:
[nl]
       You've found something strange!
$HQ0U:
[nl]
       But a «Black Rock» is inside!
$HQ0W:
It all began aeons ago, when man's ancestors picked up a shard of a strange red rock...
[pause]
Its power, which was beyond human comprehension, cultivated dreams...[nl]
In turn, love and hate were born...
[pause]
Only time will see how it all ends.
$HQ0Y:
[nl]
             You got 1 [item]!
$HQ0a:
[nl]
           You found 1 [item]!
$HQ0c:
Combine the ancient Rainbow Shell and the Sun Stone to create incredible weapons and items.
[pause]
But now, only the Guru of Life has the skill.[nl]
Elemental power usage is forbidden.
$HQ0e:
Ah![nl]
Plants are so content![nl]
I wish I could be, too.

We grew too dependent on a dangerous force.
$HRG6:
No one had ever seen the person who came looking for you.[nl]
Could he be a friend of yours?
$HRG8:
A Moon Stone left in a sunlit spot for millennia, becomes a Sun Stone![nl]
The Sun Keep of Zeal had such a Stone!
[pause]
Very old stones are required to harvest useful amounts of power.
$HRGA:
I sense strong magic, like Lavos's, emanating from that ship.
$HRGC:
Zzz...
$HRGE:
Hurray![nl]
Hurray!
$HRGG:
What a massive ship!
$HRGI:
Hey mister, is this your cat?
$HRGK:
Must have cried himself to sleep.[nl]
Let him be.
$HRGM:
Glad to see you've all recovered!
$HRGO:
I've never seen anything so ominous.
$HRGQ:
ELDER: All rested up?
$HRGS:
ELDER: We're slowly recovering.[nl]
   We've got to start from scratch.
$HRGU:
What happened?
$HRGW:
Yea![nl]
Justice![nl]
Dalton got what he deserved!
$HRGY:
ELDER: Whoa![nl]
   That ship can fly!
$HRGa:
SOLDIER: Bow, and pay homage to our new liege, King Dalton!
$HRGc:
DALTON: You there![nl]
   What's wrong?![nl]
   You're lucky to be alive!
$HRGe:
DALTON: The old crone and the pesky Gurus are gone.[nl]
   I now rename Zeal, the Kingdom of Dalton!
$HRGg:
DALTON: YOU! You're alive!?[nl]
   Ah! That vehicle outside must be yours!
[pause]
   It's just like the one Belthasar was building...
$HRGi:
DALTON: I've decided you don't deserve such a splendid toy![nl]
   Henceforth it shall be my personal chariot!
$HRGk:
Marle: Hey, you can't do that!
$HRGm:
Lucca: You've got to be joking!
$HRGo:
Robos: Impossible!
$HRGq:
Frog: Come again, Sir?!
$HRGs:
Ayla: Epoch![nl]
   It Ayla friend!
$HRGu:
DALTON: You'll have to come with me![nl]
   You might start a rebellion or something!
$HRGw:
DALTON: And now, as a token of my esteem for you...
$HRGy:
...take this!!
$HRH0:
DALTON: What!?
$HRH2:
DALTON: Grrrr.
$HRH4:
DALTON: Ha!
$HRH6:
DALTON: How's this?!
$HRH8:
DALTON: Mwa, ha, ha![nl]
   Enjoy a little taste of my true power!
$HRHA:
Magus: So, it's you...
$HRHC:
Marle: Magus...
$HRHE:
Lucca: Magus...
$HRHG:
Frog: Magus!
$HRHI:
Marle: You're...
[pause]
   ...Janus, aren't you?
$HRHK:
Lucca: You...!
[pause]
   You're...Janus?
$HRHM:
Frog: So![nl]
   Thou art...
[pause]
   ...thou art that filthy urchin!
$HRHO:
Magus: ...
$HRHQ:
Magus: Ever since Lavos's time portal stranded me in the Middle Ages...
[pause]
   I have waited to even the score.
[pause]
   You interrupted me just when I had summoned Lavos to my castle.
[pause]
   How ironic that, having been drawn into yet another portal, I would end up in this age.
[pause]
   Being from the future, my knowledge of the past enabled me to convince the Queen that I was a mighty oracle.
[pause]
   But no history book could have prepared me for what happened here.
[pause]
   Unimaginable is the power of Lavos.[nl]
   Anyone who dares to oppose...it...meets certain doom.
[pause]
   At this rate, you too, will meet a hideous fate.[nl]
   Just like that poor fool, Crono!
$HRHS:
Marle: How dare you![nl]
   It's because of you that Crono's gone!
$HRHU:
Lucca: ...![nl]
   It's your fault that Crono isn't here!
$HRHW:
Frog: ...!
[pause]
   You dare to insult him?!
$HRHY:
Magus: He's history![nl]
   Play with fire and you get burned.
$HRHa:
Marle: What an arrogant pig!
$HRHc:
Lucca: Pig!!
$HRHe:
Frog: Magus!![nl]
   Hold thy tongue!
$HRHg:
Magus: You wish to fight me?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$HRHi:
Marle: Even if we defeat you, it won't bring Crono back.
$HRHk:
Lucca: Poor Crono.[nl]
   Fighting you won't bring him back.
$HRHm:
Frog: Vanquishing thee will neither return Crono nor Cyrus.
$HRHo:
Magus: Wait.
$HRHq:
Magus: I'll come with you.
$HRHs:
Marle: Say what?
$HRHu:
Lucca: Pardon?!
$HRHw:
Frog: Treachery!!
$HRHy:
Magus: You know, there just might be a way to bring him back.
$HRI0:
Marle: Y...you're joking?!
$HRI2:
Lucca: You're joking!?
$HRI4:
Frog: Nonsense...!?
$HRI6:
Magus: Gaspar, the Guru of Time, knows how to restore lost or misplaced time streams...
$HRI8:
Magus: Very well then...
[pause]
   But you shall not defeat me easily!
$HRIA:
Magus: Defeat me, and you will break the curse on Frog.
$HRIC:
   If... you want...[nl]
   to bring Crono back...
[pause]
   find Gaspar, th...the Guru of Time...
$HRIE:
[nl]
            You got the Amulet.
$HRIG:
Frog: Stand back.
$HRII:
Magus: ...
[pause]
   I never imagined that we would settle our score in this dusty old era.[nl]
   Come, let us finish this charade!
$HRIK:
Frog: Cyrus, I hath avenged thee!
$HRIM:
Check back with him, because his wares vary from time to time.
$HRIO:
He's got more goods.
$HRIQ:
[nl]
         You found a Magic Tab!
$HRIS:
Magus: Behold.[nl]
   Everything's at the bottom of the sea.
[pause]
   Gone is the magical kingdom of Zeal, and all the dreams and ambitions of its people.
$HRIU:
Magus: I once lived there...[nl]
   But I was another person then.
$HRIW:
Magus: The lost Kingdom of Dreams.
[pause]
   Sigh...[nl]
   To have gained so much, and then have lost it again...
$HRIY:
Come again.
$HRIa:
Will you stay?[nl]
      Yes.[nl]
      No.
$HRIc:
...
$HRIe:
Dalton doesn't have what it takes to be a king.
$HRIg:
Mr. Dalton was rough on his employees and the pay wasn't great either.
$HRIi:
The Guru of Time gave me this sapling, but is there any place for it in this desolate new world?
[pause]
What shall I do?[nl]
      Burn it, it's just trash.[nl]
      Plant it, with hope.
$HRIk:
You're right, it has no place here...
$HRIm:
All right, I'll take good care of it.[nl]
Who knows? Maybe someday it will save our environment.
$HRIo:
This mysterious sapling...[nl]
Maybe someday it will help change our environment?!

;battle tutorials, Zeal stuff, fair stuff
;-----------------
$HSs4:
During combat, the effect of each attack can vary.
$HSs6:
First, some of your attacks will damage more than one enemy.
$HSs8:
For example, target this critter...
$HSsA:
...and your attack will hit another monster in the area.
$HSsC:
But if you target this one...
$HSsE:
...you can get all three at once![nl]
Use this fact to your advantage!
$HSsG:
Next, you can hit enemies in your direct line of sight.
$HSsI:
There are two attack patterns.[nl]
The first one...
$HSsK:
...allows you to attack all the enemies oriented on a straight line from you.
$HSsM:
You may place the cursor on any one of them on the line.
$HSsO:
The other pattern...
$HSsQ:
...allows you to hit only the enemies in a straight line between you and the target.
$HSsS:
As in the previous example, all 3 creatures are targeted here, but...
$HSsU:
...select this one, and that's all you'll get!
$HSsW:
Next, use an enemy to establish a line, and any others on it will also be hit.
$HSsY:
They're lined up horizontally here...
$HSsa:
The final pattern puts you at the center of the attack zone.
$HSsc:
You can't use an attack like this if your enemies are outside of the zone.
$HSse:
However, your attack will hit all enemies inside the active zone!
$HSsg:
...so you may target any of them.
$HSsi:
QUEEN: Behold, my pretties![nl]
   Destiny, in its most brutal form.
[pause]
   All the dreams that might have been.[nl]
   All the happiness, and sorrow, you might have experienced.
[pause]
   Gone forever!!![nl]
   For you there will be no tomorrow!
$HSsk:
QUEEN: The Dark Omen transcends time and space, waiting for Lavos to awaken!
[pause]
   Destiny has led you here.[nl]
   And here you shall rest forever, unless you can defeat me, and smash the Omen!
$HSsm:
QUEEN: Come, dear friends.[nl]
   Perhaps I can persuade Lavos to share his dreams with you!
[pause]
   Did I say dreams?[nl]
   I meant his eternal nightmare!
$HSso:
QUEEN: Argh![nl]
   My powers don't seem to work here!
[pause]
   Wait! I'll simply toss you into the Mammon Machine!
[pause]
   You'll be one with the Omen, Lavos...and me!
$HSsq:
[nl]
         You got the Moon Stone!
$HSss:
Lucca: This is the ancient Sun Stone?[nl]
   It doesn't seem to have an ounce of energy left in it.
$HSsu:
   We could probably recharge it with sunlight, but that would take aeons.
$HSsw:
Robos: This is the ancient Sun Stone?[nl]
   The years must have robbed it of its sparkle.
$HSsy:
   But if we expose it to sunlight for approximately 65.2167 million years we just might be able to recharge it.
$HSt0:
Magus: So this is the Sun Stone.[nl]
   Its power has been lost over time.
$HSt2:
   With the sun's energy, it could be recharged.
[pause]
   But it'll take over 65 million years.
$HSt4:
Marle: Isn't this the ancient Sun Stone?[nl]
   But it no longer glows...
$HSt6:
   Maybe it will regain its glow if we keep it in the sunlight![nl]
   Might take a while, though.
$HSt8:
Frog: 'Tis the ancient Sun Stone![nl]
   But it lacketh luster.
$HStA:
   Perhaps the sun can rekindle it![nl]
   But how long will that take?
$HStC:
That brat, Lucca, says she's made the discovery of a lifetime.
$HStE:
Heh, heh...you're never too old to collect Silver Points!
$HStG:
Hmm...[nl]
It's taking forever for the King's parade to begin.[nl]
I wonder if something's wrong?
$HStI:
I'm so happy I could scream!
